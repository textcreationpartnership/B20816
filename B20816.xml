            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I conceived it would have been a prejudice to the agreeable ſimplicity of the <hi>Stile,</hi> to have changed the Dreſs of it into our <hi>Modern Language,</hi> as ſome adviſed. Yet certain more out of Faſhion, <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Phraſes,</hi> I thought meet to explain in the <hi>Margine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was deſirous to have told thee ſomewhat of the happy <hi>Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Compiler</hi> of theſe <hi>Revelations:</hi> But after all the ſearch I could make, I could not diſcover any thing touching her, more than what ſhe occaſionally ſprinkles in the <hi>Book</hi> it ſelf. The <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> acquaints us with her <hi>Name, Juliana:</hi> As likewiſe her <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which was of the ſtricteſt ſort of <hi>Solitary Livers;</hi> being Incloſed all her life (alone) within <hi>four Walls:</hi> whereby, though all <hi>Mortals</hi> were excluded from her dwelling, yet <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>the Supream King of both,</hi> could, and did find Admittance. Moreover, in the ſame <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> we find, that the <hi>Place</hi> in a high
<pb facs="tcp:204885:7"/> manner dignified by her abode, and by the acceſs of her Heavenly Gueſt, was the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> when ſhe lived, and particalarly, when theſe <hi>Celeſtial Revelations</hi> were afforded her, ſhe her ſelf in the beginning of the <hi>Book</hi> informes us, was in the year of <hi>Grace MCCCLXXIII.</hi> that is, about three years before the death of the famous <hi>Conquerour, King Edward the Third:</hi> At which time ſhe her ſelf was about <hi>Thirty years</hi> of age. And to conclude, in the laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> ſhe ſignifies, that <hi>more than Fifteen years</hi> after theſe <hi>Revelations</hi> had been ſhewed her, how for reſolution of a certain <hi>Doubt</hi> of hers touching the <hi>meaning</hi> of one of them, <hi>Our Lord</hi> himſelf was pleaſed to <hi>anſwer her Internally in Ghoſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Manner</hi> of theſe <hi>Revelations,</hi> it was the ſame of which we read innumerable Examples, both among <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern Saints.</hi> The <hi>Objects</hi> of ſome of them were repreſented to the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and perhaps alſo to the <hi>outward Sight;</hi> ſometimes they were repreſented in <hi>Sleep,</hi> but moſt frequently when ſhe was <hi>Awake.</hi> But thoſe which were more <hi>pure, in time</hi> and withall more <hi>certain,</hi> were wrought by a <hi>Divine Illapſe</hi> into the <hi>Spiritual part</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> cannot counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, nor the <hi>Patient</hi> comprehend, though withal it excluded all Doubt or Suſpicion of Illuſion.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>principal thing</hi> which I deſire to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Conſideration, is the <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Occaſion,</hi> and <hi>Subſequent Effects</hi> of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:204885:7"/> 
               <hi>Divine Favours</hi> beſtowed by <hi>Almighty God</hi> on his Humble Devout <hi>Handmaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was far from expecting, or deſiring ſuch unuſual Supernatural Gifts. Matters ſtood thus with her: She thought her ſelf too much unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in her Affection to Creatures, and too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of our Lords Love to her. Therefore to cure the <hi>former,</hi> ſhe requeſted a <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, even to <hi>death,</hi> in her own and others Conceit; a <hi>Sickneſs</hi> full of bitter pain and anguiſh, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her of all outward Refreſhments, and of all inward Comforts alſo, which might affect the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Portion of the Soul. And for a remedy to the <hi>Latter,</hi> ſhe begg'd of <hi>our Lord,</hi> that he would Imprint in her Soul, by what way he thought beſt, a deep and vigorous Conception, and Reſentment of thoſe moſt violent Torments, which he in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Love</hi> ſuffered for her on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to the end ſhe might be even forced to return to him a ſuitable affection.</p>
            <p>Yet in making theſe <hi>Requeſts,</hi> ſhe expreſſed a perfect <hi>Reſignation</hi> (as to the <hi>manner)</hi> to his Heavenly Will. The only <hi>graces</hi> that ſhe did, and might, and ſo may we, deſire <hi>abſolutely, without any Condition,</hi> were a true <hi>Spiritual Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of her ſelf, and of all worldly, or ſenſual Contentments; a perfect <hi>Sorrow</hi> and compunction for <hi>Sins</hi> paſt; and a Cordial <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Reverential Fear</hi> of <hi>Almighty God.</hi> Theſe were the Gifts ſhe deſired: And as for the <hi>means</hi> of procuring theſe <hi>Graces,</hi> ſhe propoſed the beſt to her ſeeming: yet ſo, as being aſſured that <hi>God</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:204885:8"/> knew what was beſt for her, ſhe left them to his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was, no doubt, by <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> that ſhe at firſt made ſuch <hi>Petitions,</hi> both for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> and therefore <hi>God</hi> granted them as ſhe deſired; yea, in a manner more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary than ſhe durſt pretend to, as the <hi>Reader</hi> may obſerve. And how wonderful the <hi>Effects</hi> of them were, the whole contexture of her Diſcourſes upon each <hi>Revelation</hi> will excellently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>And now, ſince ſhe her ſelf profeſſes, that the <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Torches</hi> which <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to give her, were intended not for her ſelf alone, but for the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of <hi>God's</hi> true Servants, for whoſe benefit alſo ſhe wrote them, the Devout <hi>Reader</hi> will, I hope, think himſelf obliged not to content himſelf with a fruitleſs admiring, but will, after her example, aſpire to alike affectuous, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the meer <hi>Nothingneſs</hi> of <hi>Creatures,</hi> of the inconceivable <hi>uglineſs</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> of the infinite <hi>tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>indefectibility</hi> of <hi>God's Love</hi> to his <hi>Elect,</hi> and of the <hi>Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> working in them; to which <hi>Grace</hi> alone all <hi>Good</hi> in us is to be aſcribed.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> was bodilie Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third,</hi> was to have of <hi>Gods</hi> gift three Woundes: For the firſt, me thought I had ſome deale feeling in the Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but yet I deſired to have more by the Grace of <hi>God.</hi> Me thought I would have been that time with <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and with other that were <hi>Chriſts</hi> Lovers, that I might have ſeen bodilie the Paſſion that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffered for me, that I might have ſuffered with him as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did that loved him; and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a bodilie ſight, wherein I might have more knowledge of the bodilie paines of our Saviour, and of the Compaſſion of <hi>Our Lady,</hi> and of all his true Lovers that were living that time, and ſaw his Paines: For I would have

Other ſight nor ſhewing of <hi>God</hi> deſired I never none, till when the Soule were departed from the body, for I believed to be ſaved by the Mercy of <hi>God.</hi> This was my meaning; for I would after becauſe of that ſhewing have the more true mind in the Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For the <hi>ſecond</hi> came to my mind with Contrition free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, without anie ſeeking, a <note n="|" place="margin">i. e. <hi>earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi>
                     </note> wilfull deſire to have of <hi>Gods</hi> Gift, a bodilie ſicknes. I would that that ſicknes were ſo hard as to the death, that I might in that ſicknes have undertaken all the Rights of Holie Church, my ſelf weening that I ſhould have died, and that all Creatures might ſuppoſe the ſame that ſaw me: For I would have no manner of Comfort of fleſhly, ne earthly Life in that ſicknes. I deſired to have all manner of Paines, Bodilie and Ghoſtlie, that I ſhould have if I ſhould have died: All the Dreads and Temptations of <hi>fiends,</hi> and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other Paines, ſaving the out-paſſing of the Soule. And this meant I, for I would be purged by the Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> and after live more to the Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> becauſe of that ſicknes. For I hoped that it might have bene to my reward when I ſhould have died, for I deſired to have bene ſoone with my <hi>God</hi> and Maker.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two deſires of the Paſſion, and of the ſicknes that I deſired of him was with a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For me thought this was not the common uſe of Praier. Therefore I ſaid, <hi>Lord thou</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This ſiicknes I deſired in my Youth, that I might have it when I were thirtie Years Old.</p>
                  <p>For the third, by the Grace of <hi>God</hi> and teaching of Holie Church, I conceived a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deſire to receive <hi>three</hi> Wounds in my Life, that is to ſay, the Wound of verie <hi>Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the Wound of kind <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and the Wound of <hi>willful Longing</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Right as I asked the other twaine with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo asked I this third mightilie without any Condition. Theſe twaine deſires before ſaid, paſſed from my mind, and the third dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led continuallie.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And I underſtood in my reaſon, and by the feeling of my paines that I ſhould die: and I aſſented fullie with all the will of myne heart to be at <hi>Gods</hi> will.</p>
                  <p>Thus I endured till daie, and by then was my bodie dead from the middes downwarde, as to my feeling.</p>
                  <p>Then was I holpen to be ſett upright, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett with help for to have the more freedome of my heart to be at <hi>Gods</hi> will, and thinking on <hi>God</hi> while my life laſted.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Curate</hi> was ſent for to be at my ending, and before he came I had ſett up my eien, and might not ſpeak.

                  <p>But nevertheleſſe I aſſented to ſett my eien in the face of the Crucifix, if I might, and ſo I did; for me thought I might longer dure to

After this my ſight began to faile, it waxed as darke about me in the Chamber as if it had bene Night, ſave in the Image of the Croſſe, wherein held a common Light, and I wiſt not how; all that was beſides the Croſſe was uglie and fearefull to me, as it had bene much occupied with fiendes.</p>

                     </note> unneath I had any feeling, my moſt paine was ſhortnes of Breath, and failing of Life.</p>
                  <p>Then went I verilie to have paſſed, and in this caſe ſodenlie all my paine was taken from me, and I was as <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>thought.</hi>
                     </note> whole, and namely in the over-part of my bodie as ever I was before. I marvailed of this ſodaine change: For me thought that it was a privie working of <hi>God,</hi> and not of <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </note> kind. And yet by feeling of this eaſe, I truſted never the more to have lived; ne the feeling of this eaſe was no full eaſe unto me: for me thought I had rather have bene deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this World, for my heart was wilfullie ſett thereto.</p>
                  <p>Then came ſodeinlie to my minde, that I ſhould deſire the ſeconde Wound of our <hi>Lords</hi> Gift, and of his Grace, that my bodie might be fulfilled with mind and feeling of his bleſſed Paſſion, as I had before praied.

                  <p>Thus thought me, that I might with his

                  <p>But, What beheld I therein? verilie the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the Keeper, the Lover: For till I am ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciallie united to him, I maie never have full reſt, ne verie bliſſe; that is to ſaie, that I be ſo faſtned to him, that there be right nought that is made betweene my <hi>God</hi> and mee.</p>
                  <p>This litle thing that is made, me thought it might have fallen to nought for litleneſs.</p>
                  <p>Of this needeth us to have knowledge, that us liketh naught all thing that is made, for to love <hi>God,</hi> and have <hi>God</hi> that is unmade.</p>
                  <p>For this is the cauſe which we be not all in eaſe of Heart and Soule: For we ſeeke here reſt in this thing that is ſo litle, where no reſt is in: and we know not our <hi>God</hi> that is all Mightie, all Wiſe, and all Good, for he is verie reſt.</p>

                  <p>For all that is beneath him, ſufficeth not us.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Cauſe why that no Soule is in Reſt till it is <note n="*" place="margin">i. e: <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied.</hi>
                     </note> naughted of all things that are made: When ſhe is wilfullie naughted for love to have him that is all, then is ſhe able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave Ghoſtlie reſt.</p>
                  <p>And alſo our good <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed, that it is full great pleaſure to him that a ſeelie Soule come to him naked, plainlie, and homelie: For this is the kind dwelling of the Soule by the touching of the Holie Ghoſt, as by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that I have in this ſhewing: <hi>God of thy goodnes give me thy ſelf, for thou art e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to me; And I may aske nothing that is leſſe, that may be fullie Worſhip to thee; and if I aske any thing that is leſſe, ever me wanteth: But onlie in thee I have all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe wordes of the Goodnes of <hi>God</hi> be full love-ſome to the Soule, and full nere touching the Will of our <hi>Lord;</hi> for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fulfilleth all his Creatures, and all his bleſſed Works without end.</p>
                  <p>For he is the endleſſe head, and he made us onlie to himſelfe: and reſtored us by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Paſſion, and ever keepeth us in his bleſſed Love; and all this is of his Goodnes.</p>

                  <p>THis ſhewing was given to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to learne our Soule wiſely to cleave to the Goodnes of <hi>God,</hi> and in that ſame time the cuſtome of our Praier was brought to my mind, how that we uſe, for unknowing of Love, to make many meanes. Then ſawe I verilie that it is more worſhip to <hi>God,</hi> and more verie delight that we faithfullie pray to himſelf of his Goodnes, and cleave therto by his Grace with true underſtanding and ſtedfaſt beleif, then if we made all the meanes that heart may think.</p>
                  <p>For if we make all theſe meanes, it is too litle, and not full Worſhip to <hi>God:</hi> But in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is all the whole, and there faileth right nought.</p>
                  <p>For thus as I ſhall ſaie, came to my minde in the ſame time: We Pray to <hi>God</hi> for his Holie fleſh, and for his precious Blood, his Holie Paſſion, his deare worthie Death, and worſhipfull Wounds, for all the bleſſed kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and the endles Life that we have of all this, it is of the Goodnes of <hi>God;</hi> and we Praie him for his ſweet <hi>Mothers</hi> Love that bare him; and all the helpe that we have of her it is of his Goodnes: And we Praie for his Holie Croſſe that he died on, and all the helpe, and all the vertue of that we have of that Croſſe, it is of his Goodnes.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:204885:15"/>
                  <p>And on the ſame wiſe, all the helpe that we have to ſpecial Saints, and of all the bleſſed Companie of Heaven, the deare worthie Love, and the Holy endles Friendſhip that we have of them, it is of his Goodnes.</p>
                  <p>For the meanes that the Goodnes of <hi>God</hi> hath ordeined for to helpe us, be full faire and many.</p>
                  <p>Of which the chiefe and principall meane is the bleſſed <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi>
                     </note> kind that he took of the Maiden, with all the meanes that went before, and come after, which be longing to our Redemption and to our endleſs Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it pleaſeth him, that we ſeeke him, and Worſhip him by Meanes, Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knowing that he is the Goodnes of all.</p>
                  <p>For to the Goodnes of <hi>God</hi> is the higheſt Praier, and it cometh down to us to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt partie of our neede, it quickneth our Soule, and maketh it live, and makes it to waxe in Grace and Vertue, it is neareſt in kind and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt in Grace.</p>
                  <p>For it is the ſame Grace that the Soule ſeeketh, and ever ſhall till we know our <hi>God</hi> verilie that hath us all in himſelf becloſed.</p>
                  <p>A man goeth upright, and the Soule of his body is <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</hi>

                     </note> honeſtlie.</p>
                  <p>And that it is he that doth this, it is ſhewed there where he ſaith, <hi>He cometh downe to us</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:204885:16"/> 
                     <hi>to the loweſt part of our need.</hi> For he hath no deſpite of that he made, ne hath he no diſdaine to ſerve us at the ſimpleſt office that to our bodie longeth in kind, for love of the Soule that he made to his own likenes.</p>
                  <p>For as the Bodie is cladd in the Cloath and the Fleſh in the Skinn, and the Bones in the Fleſh, and the Heart in the bulke, ſo are we Soule and Bodie cladd and encloſed in the Goodnes of <hi>God:</hi> Yea, and more <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>

                  <p>For truelie our Lover deſireth that the Soule cleave to him with all the mightes, and that we be evermore cleaving to his Goodnes: for of all thing that heart can thinke it pleaſeth moſt <hi>God,</hi> and ſooneſt ſpeedeth.</p>
                  <p>For our Soule is ſo preciouſlie loved of him that is higheſt, that it over-paſſeth the knowing of all Creatures:</p>
                  <p>That is to ſaie, There is no Creature that is made, that may wit how much, and how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and how tenderlie that our Maker loveth us. And therefore, we may with his Grace and his helpe, ſtand in Ghoſtlie beholding with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting marvailing in this high over-paſſing, unmeaſurable Love that our <hi>Lord</hi> hath to us of his Goodnes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, we may aske of our Lover, with Reverence, all that we will: for our <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</hi>
                     </note> kindlie Will is to have <hi>God,</hi> and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204885:16"/> of <hi>God</hi> is to have us: And we may never ceaſe of willing, ne of loving till we have him in fulhead of joy.</p>
                  <p>And then we may no more will, for he will that we be occupied in knowing and loving, till the time cometh that we ſhall be fulfilled in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And therefore was this Leſſon of Love ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all that followeth as you ſhall ſee; for the ſtrength and the ground of all was ſhewed in the firſt ſight: for of all things, the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the loving of the Maker, maketh the Soul to ſeem leaſt in his own ſight, and moſt filleth it with reverent dread and true meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with plenty of Charity to his even Chriſtian.</p>

                  <p>This Wiſdom and Truth made her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her <hi>God</hi> ſo Great, ſo High, ſo Mighty, and ſo Good. This greatneſs and this <note n="|" place="margin">i. e. <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs.</hi>

                     <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blety</hi> of her beholding of <hi>God,</hi> fulfilled her of reverend deed: And with this ſhe ſaw her ſelf ſo litle and ſo low, ſo ſimple and ſo poor, in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204885:17"/> regard of her <hi>God,</hi> that this reverend Dread fulfilled her of meekneſs. And thus by this ground ſhe was fulfilled of Grace, and of all manner of Vertues, and paſſeth all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>And in all the time that he ſhewed this that I have now ſaid in Ghoſtly ſight. I ſaw the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſight, laſting of the plentuous bleeding of the head, the great drops of Blood fell down from under the Garland like Pellots, ſeeming as it had come out of the Veins: And in the coming out they were brown red, for the blood was full thick, and in the ſpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they were bright red; and when it came at the <note n="|" place="margin">i. e. <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
                     </note> Brows, there they vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding, the bleeding continued till many things were ſeen and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nevertheleſs, the fair head, and the lively head continued in the ſame beauty and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The plentuous head is like to the drops of Water that fall off the eveſing of an Houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great ſhower of Rain, that fall ſo thick, that no man may number them with any bodily Wit. And for the roundneſs, they were like to the Seal of her Ring in the ſpreading of the forehead.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three things came to my mind in the time, Pellets for the roundhead in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the blood; the Scale of Herring, for the round-head in the ſpreading; the dropps of the eveſing of an Houſe, for the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous head unnumerable.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:204885:17"/>
                  <p>This ſhewing was quick and lively, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous, and dreadful, and ſweet, and lovely. And of all the ſight that I ſaw, this was moſt comfort to me, that our good <hi>Lord</hi> that is ſo reverent and dreadful, is ſo homely and ſo courteous: And this moſt fulfilled me with liking and ſickneſs <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>in</hi>
                     </note> of Soul.</p>
                  <p>And to the underſtanding of this, he ſhewed this open example. <hi>It is the moſt worſhip that a ſolemn King or a great Lord may do to a poor Servant, if he will be homely with him; and namely, if he ſhew it himſelf of a full true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with a glad chere both in private and openly.</hi> Then thinketh this poor Creature thus: <hi>Lo, what might this Noble Lord do more Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Joy to me, than to ſhew to me that am ſo little: This marvelous himelineſs, verily it is more joy and liking to me, than if he gave me great gifts, and were himſelf ſtrange in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This bodily example was ſhewed ſo high, that this mans heart might be raviſhed, and almoſt forget himſelf for Joy of this great homeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus it faireth by our <hi>Lord Jeſu,</hi> and by us, for verily it is the moſt joy that may be as to my ſight, that he that is higheſt and mighteſt, noblieſt and worthieſt, is loweſt and meekeſt, homlieſt and courteſieſt. And truly and verily, this marvellous joy ſhall he ſhew us all when we ſhall ſee him.</p>
                  <p>And this will our good <hi>Lord,</hi> that we believe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204885:18"/> and truſt, joy, and like comfort us, and make ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, as we may with his Grace and with his Help, into the time that we ſee it verily; for the moſt fulhed of joy that we ſhall have as to my ſight, is this marvellous courteſie and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of our Father that is our Maker in our <hi>Lord Jeſu Chriſt,</hi> that is our Brother and our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>But this marvelous Homllineſs may no man know in this Life, but if he have it by ſpecial ſhewing of our <hi>Lord,</hi> or of great plenty of Grace inwardly given of the Holy Ghoſt, but Faith and Belief with Charity deſerve the meed, and ſo it is had by Grace.</p>
                  <p>For in Faith, with Hope and Charity, our Life is grounded; the ſhewing is made to whom that <hi>God</hi> will plainly teach, the ſame opened and declared with many privy Points belonging to our Faith and Belief, which be worſhipful to be known.</p>
                  <p>And when the ſhewing which is given for a time is paſſed and hid, then Faith keepeth it by Grace of the Holy Ghoſt unto our Lives end.</p>
                  <p>And thus by the ſhewing, it is none other than Faith, no leſs, no more, as it may be ſeen by our <hi>Lords</hi> meaning in the ſame matter, by than it come to the laſt end.</p>

                  <p>All this was ſhewed by three parts; that is to ſay, by bodily ſight, and by words formed in my underſtanding, and by Ghoſtly ſight; but the Ghoſtly ſight I cannot, ne may ſhew it as openly, ne as fully as I would; but I truſt in our <hi>Lord God</hi> Almighty, that he ſhall of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for your Love, make you to take it more Ghoſtly and more ſweetly than I can or may tell it.</p>

                     <hi>The Second Revelation. The</hi> x. <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ANd after this, I ſaw with bodily ſight, in the face of the Crucifix that hung before me: In the which, I beheld continually a part of his Paſſion; deſpite, ſpitting, ſulloing and buffeting, and many languring Pains, more than I can tell; and often changing of Colour: and one time I ſaw how half the face, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Ear, over <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi>
                     </note> yede with dry Blood, till it cloſed into the mid-face: And after that, the other half be cloſed in the ſame wiſe: And the whiles, it vaniſhed in this party even as it came.</p>
                  <p>This ſaw I bodily <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely.</hi>
                     </note> ſweinly and darkly; and I deſired more bodily light to have ſeen more clearly, and I was anſwered in my reaſon, <hi>If God will ſhew thee more, he ſhall be thy light, thou need none but him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I ſaw him and ſought him: for we be now ſo blind and ſo unwiſe, that we can never ſeek <hi>God</hi> till what time that he of his Goodneſs ſheweth him to us. And when we ſee ought of him graciouſly, then are we ſtirred by the ſame Grace, to ſeek with great deſire to ſee him more bleſſedfully: And thus I ſaw him and ſought him, and I had him and wanted him: And this is and ſhould be our common working in this life, as to my ſight.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:204885:21"/>
                  <p>One time my Underſtanding was litle down into the Sea-ground; and there ſaw I Hills, and Dales green, ſeeming as it were moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growing with Wrake and Gravel: Then I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood thus, that if a Man or Woman were there under the broad Water, and he might have ſight of <hi>God,</hi> ſo as <hi>God</hi> is with a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, he ſhould be ſafe in Soul and Body, and take no harm, and <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</hi>
                     </note> over-paſſing, he ſhould have more ſolace and comfort than all this World may or can tell.</p>
                  <p>For he will that we believe that we ſee him continually, though that us think that it be but litle, and in the belief he maketh us evermore to get Grace; for he will be ſeen, and he will be ſought, and he will be abiden, and he will be truſted.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond ſhewing was ſo low, and ſo litle, and ſo ſimple, that my Spirits were in great Travail in the beholding, mourning, dreadful, and longing; for I was ſometime in a fear, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a ſhewing or none; and then divers times our <hi>Lord</hi> gave me more ſight, whereby that I underſtood truly, that it was a ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>It was a Figure and a Likeneſs of our foul black deeds, which our fair bright bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> bare for our ſin. It made me to think of the Holy <note n="†" place="margin">i e. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronica.</hi>
                     </note> Vernacle of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he protraid with his own bleſſed face, when he was in his hard Paſſion, wilfully going to his Death, and often changing of Colour, of the brown-head,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204885:21"/> and the black-head, rewlyhead and lean-head.</p>
                  <p>Of this Image many marvelled how that might be ſtanding, that he protraid it with his bleſſed face, which is the faireſt of Heaven, Flower of Earth, and the fruit of the Maidens Womb. Then how might this Image be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured and ſo far from fair-head, I deſire to ſee as I have underſtood by the Grace of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We know in our Faith and in our Belief, by the Teaching and Preaching of Holy Church, that the bleſſedfull Trinity made Mankind to his Image and Likeneſs: In the ſame manner wiſe we know, that when man fell ſo deep and ſo wretchedly by Sin, there was none other help to reſtore man but through him that made man.</p>
                  <p>And he that made man for Love, by the ſame Love he would reſtore man to the ſame bliſs and over-paſſing.</p>
                  <p>And right as we were made like to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in our firſt making, our Maker would that we ſhould be like to <hi>Jeſu Chriſt</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in Heaven without end by the vertue of our own making.</p>
                  <p>Then between theſe two he would for Love, and for Worſhip of man, make himſelf as like to man in this deadly Life, in our foul-head, and in our wretchedneſs, as man might be without guilt: Whereof it meaneth as is before ſaid, it was the Image and the Likeneſs of our foul
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204885:22"/> black deeds, wherein our fair bright bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> hid his God-head.</p>
                  <p>But verily I dare ſay, and we ought to believe, that ſo fair a man was never none but he, till what time that his fair Colour was changed with Travaile and Sorrow, Paſſion and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Of this it ſpeaketh in the Second Revelation, and in the <hi>xviijth.</hi> Chapter, where it ſpeaketh more of the ſame likeneſs. And there it ſaith of the Vernacle of <hi>Rome,</hi> it meaneth by diverſe changing of Colour, and either ſometime more comfortable and lively, and ſometime more ruful and deadly, as it may be ſeen hereafter; and this Viſion was a learning to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the continually ſeeking of the Soul pleaſeth <hi>God</hi> much; for it may do no more than ſeek, ſuffer, and truſt.</p>
                  <p>And this is wrought in every Soul that hath it by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>And the clearneſs of finding it, is of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, when it is his will; the ſeeking with Faith, Hope and Charity, pleaſeth our <hi>Lord;</hi> and the finding, pleaſeth the Soul, and fulfilleth it with joy.</p>
                  <p>And thus was I learned to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſeeking is as good as heholding, for the time that he will ſuffer the Soul to be in Travaile. It is <hi>God</hi>'s Will that we ſeek into the beholding of him; for by that ſhall he ſhew us himſelf of his ſpecial Grace, when he will.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:204885:22"/>
                  <p>And how a Soul ſhall <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have.</hi>
                     </note> have her in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, he ſhall teach himſelf, and that is moſt Worſhip to him, and moſt profit to the Soul, and moſt received of Meekneſs and Vertues, with the Grace and leading of the Holy Ghoſt; for a Soul that only reſigneth him to <hi>God</hi> with very truſt, either in ſeeking or in beholding, it is the moſt Worſhip that he may do, as to my ſight.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be two Workings that may be ſeen in this Viſion: That one is <hi>ſeeking,</hi> the other is <hi>beholding:</hi> The <hi>ſeeking</hi> is common, that each Soul may have with his Grace, and ought to have diſcretion and teaching of Holy Church.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>God</hi>'s Will that we have <hi>three</hi> things in our ſeeking of his Gift. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that we ſeek <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.</hi>
                     </note> wilfully and buſily without ſloath, as it may be with his Grace, gladly and merrily, without unreaſonable Heavineſs and vain-ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> that we abide him ſtedfaſtly for his Love, without grudging and ſtriving againſt him into Lives end, for it ſhall laſt but a while. The <hi>third</hi> is, that we truſt in him mightily of full and true Faith: For it is his will that we know, that he ſhall appear ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſſedfully to all his Lovers.</p>
                  <p>For his Working is privy, and he will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and his appearing ſhall be ſweet, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and he will be truſted, for he is full <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar.</hi>
                     </note> home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, curteous: Bleſſed mote he be.</p>

                  <head>The Third Revelation. The xj. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>ANd after this, I ſaw <hi>God</hi> in a Point; that is to ſay, in my underſtanding: By which ſight I ſaw that he is in all thing. I beheld with adviſement, ſeeing and knowing in that ſight, that he doth all that is done. I marvelled in that ſight with a ſoft dread, and thought what is <hi>ſin:</hi> For I ſaw truly, that <hi>God</hi> doth all thing, be it never ſo litle. And I ſaw verily, that nothing is done <hi>by happ,</hi> ne by adventure, but all by the aforeſaid Wiſdom of <hi>God;</hi> if it be <hi>happ</hi> or Adventure in the ſight of man, our blind-head and un-fore-ſight is the cauſe. For thoſe things that be in the foreſaid Wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> been fro without beginning, which Rightfully and Worſhipfully continually he leadeth to the beſt end: As it cometh about falling to us ſuddenly, our unwitting. And thus by our blindneſs, and our unforeſight, we ſay theſe things be <hi>by happs</hi> and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Thus I underſtand in this ſhewing of Love: For well I wot in the fight of our <hi>Lord God,</hi> is no happ, ne Adventure. Wherefore me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved needs to grant, that all things that are done, are well done; for our <hi>Lord God</hi> doth all: For in this time the Working of Creatures was not ſhewed, but of our <hi>Lord God</hi> in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204885:23"/> Creatures; for he is in the mid Point of all things, and all he doth. And I am ſure that he doth no ſin.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſaw verily that ſin is no deed; for in all this, ſin was not ſhewed. And I would no longer marvel in this, but beheld our <hi>Lord</hi> what he would ſhew.</p>
                  <p>And thus as it might be for the time, the rightfulneſs of <hi>God</hi>'s Work was ſhewed for the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rightfulneſs</hi> hath two fair Properties. It is <hi>right,</hi> and it is <hi>full:</hi> And ſo be all the Works of our <hi>Lord.</hi> And thereto needeth neither Working of Mercy ne Grace: For they be all rightful, wherein faileth right nought. And in an other time, he ſhewed for beholding of ſin naked as I ſhall ſay. After when he uſeth working of Mercy and of Grace: This Viſion was ſhewed to my underſtanding: For our <hi>Lord</hi> will have the Soul turned truly unto the beholding of him, and generally of all his Works, for they be full good. And all his <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </note> Dooms be eaſie and ſweet, and <hi>two great eyes</hi> bringing the Soul that is turned from the beholding of the blind deeming of man, into the faire ſweet deeming of our <hi>Lord God.</hi> For man, he holdeth ſome deeds well done, and ſome deeds evil: And our <hi>Lord</hi> beholdeth them not ſo, for as all that hath being in kind is of <hi>God</hi>'s making, ſo is all thing that is done in Property of <hi>Gods</hi> doing: For it is eaſie to underſtand, that the beſt deed is well done,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204885:24"/> and ſo well as the beſt deed that is done, and the higheſt, ſo well is the leaſt deed done: And all in the Property and in the Order that our <hi>Lord</hi> hath it ordeined tofore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning: For there is no Door but he.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw full truly, that he changed never his purpoſe in no manner of thing, ne never ſhall without end: For there was nothing unknown to him in his rightful Ordinance fro without beginning. And therefore all thing were ſet in order ere any thing was made, as it ſhould ſtand without end; and no manner of thing ſhall fail of that Point; for he hath made all thing in fulhead of Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the <hi>bleſſed Trinity</hi> is ever full pleaſed in all his Works: And all this ſhewed he full bleſſedly, meaning thus: <hi>See I am God: See I am in all things: See I do all things: See I never left my hands of my Works, ne never ſhall without end: See I lead all thing to the end that I ordaine it to; for without beginning, by the ſame Might, Wiſdom, and Love, that I made it with, How ſhould any thing be amiſs?</hi> Thus mightily, wiſely, and lovingly was the Soul examined in this Viſion. Then ſaw I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that me behoveth needs to aſſent with great Reverence and Joy in <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>ANd after this I ſaw beholding the body plentuouſly bleeding, in ſeeming of the ſcourging, as thus: The fair Skin was broken full deep into the tender fleſh, with ſharp ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, all about the ſweet Body: The hot blood ran out ſo plenteouſly, that there was neither ſeen Skin, ne Wound, but as it were all blood. And when it came where it ſhould have fallen down, there it vaniſhed: Notwithſtanding the bleeding continued a while, till it might be ſeen with adviſement. And this was, ſo plentuous to my ſight, that me thought if it had been ſo in kind and in ſubſtance for that time, it ſhould have made the Bed all on blood, and have paſſed over all about.</p>
                  <p>Then came to my mind, that <hi>God</hi> hath made Waters plentuous in Earth to our ſervice, and to our bodily eaſe, for tender Love that he hath to us: But yet liketh him better, that we take full holſomely his bleſſed Blood to waſh us from ſin, for there is no Liquor that is made that liketh him ſo well to give us: For it is moſt plentuous, as it is moſt precious, and that by the vertue of the bleſſed <hi>Godhead,</hi> and it is our own kind, and bleſſedfully overfloweth us by the vertue of his precious Love. The dear wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy blood of our <hi>Lord Jeſu Chriſt,</hi> alſo verily

The precious plenty of his dear wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Blood aſcendeth up into Heaven in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Body of our <hi>Lord Jeſu Chriſt:</hi> And there is in him Bleeding, Praying for us to the <hi>Father,</hi> and is and ſhall be as long as us needeth.

And he hath as much ſorrow when <hi>God</hi> giveth him leave to Work, as when he worketh not; And that is, for he may never do as ill as he would, for his might is all locked in <hi>God</hi>'s hand; but in <hi>God</hi> may be no wrath as to my fight: For our good <hi>Lord</hi> endleſly having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own Worſhip, and to the profit of all them that ſhall be ſaved with Might and Right, he withſtandeth the reproved, the which of malice and of ſhrewdneſs buſie them to contrary, and do againſt <hi>God</hi>'s will.</p>
                  <p>Alſo I ſaw our <hi>Lord</hi> ſcorning his malice, and naughting his unmight: And he will that we do ſo. For this fight I laught mightly, and that made them to laugh that were about me, and their laughing was a liking to me: I thought that I would that all my <hi>even Chriſten</hi> had ſeen as I ſaw, then ſhould all they have laughed with me; but I ſaw not <hi>Chriſt</hi> laughing: But well I wot that ſight that he ſhewed me, made

For his Paſſion ſhewed to me moſt properly in his bleſſed Face, and namely in his Lips: Therein I ſaw theſe <hi>four</hi> Colours; thoſe that were before freſh and ruddy, lively and liking to my ſight. This was a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Changing, to ſee this deep dying; and alſo his moſt * cloggering together and dried to my ſight: And the ſweet Body waxed brown and black, all changed and turned out of the fair, freſh, and lively Colour of himſelf, into dry dying; for that ſame time that our <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> dyed upon the Roode, it was a dry ſharp Wind, wonder could, as to my ſight: And what time that the precious Blood was bled out of the ſweet Body that might paſs therefro, yet there was a moiſture in the ſweet fleſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it was ſhewed.

Thus I ſaw the ſweet fleſh dry in my ſight, part after part drying with marvellous pain; and as long as any Spirit had life in <hi>Chriſts</hi> fleſh, ſo long ſuffered he.

                  <p>ANd in this drying, was brought to my mind this word that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>I thirſt:</hi> For I ſaw in <hi>Chriſt</hi> a double Thirſt, one Bodily, and another Ghoſtly. This Word was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the bodily Thirſt: And for the Ghoſtly Thirſt was ſhewed as I ſhall ſay after. And I underſtood by the bodily Thirſt, that the Body had feeling of moiſture; for the bleſſed Fleſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204885:29"/> and Bones was left all alone without blood and moiſture. The bleſſed Body dried all alone long time with wringing of the Nails and weight of the Body; for I underſtood that for tenderneſs of the ſweet Hands, and the ſweet Feet, by the great hardneſs and grievouſneſs of the Nails, the Wounds waxed wide, and the Body ſetled for weight by long time hanging, and pearcing and raiſing of the Head, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Crown, all baken with dry blood, with the ſweet Hair clinging the dry fleſh to the Thorns, and the Thorns to the fleſh dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And in the beginning while the fleſh was freſh and bleeding, the continual ſetting of the Thorns made the Wounds wide. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, I ſaw, that the ſweet skin, and the tender fleſh, with the hair, and with the blood, was all raced and looſed about with the Thorns, and broken in many pieces, and were hanging as they would haſtily have fallen down while it had kind moiſture; how it was down I ſaw not, but I underſtood that it was with the ſharp Thorns, and the boyſtrous grievous ſitting on of the Garland, not ſparing, and without pity, that altho brake the ſweet skin with the fleſh, and the Hair looſed it from the bone; where through it was broken in pieces as a Cloath, and ſagging downward, as it would haſtily have fallen for heavineſs and for looſneſs. And that was great ſorrow and dread to me, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought that I would not for my life have ſeen it fall.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:204885:30"/>
                  <p>This continued a while, and after it began to change; and I beheld and marvelled how it might be, and then I ſaw it was, for it began to dry, and ſtint a part of the weight that was round about the Garland: And ſo it was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned all about, as it were Garland upon Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the Garland of Thornes was dyed with the Garland of Blood, and that other Garland and the Head all was one Colour as clottered blood when it was dried: The skin and the fleſh that ſeemed of the Face and of the Body, was ſmall rimpild with a tawny Colour, like a dry board when it is aged, and the face more brown than the body. I ſaw <hi>four</hi> manner of drying: The <hi>firſt</hi> was bloodleſs: The <hi>ſecond</hi> Pain following after: The <hi>third</hi> is, that he was hanging up in the Aire, as men hang a Cloath for to dry: The <hi>fourth,</hi> that the bodily kind asked Liquor, and there was no manner of Comfort miniſtred to him. Ah, hard and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous was that Pain, but much more hard and grievous it was when the moiſture failed, and all began to dry thus clinging. Theſe were <hi>two</hi> Pains that ſhewed in the bleſſed Head. The <hi>firſt</hi> wrought to the drying while it was moiſt, and that other ſlow, with clinging and drying, with blowing of Wind from without; that dryed him more, and pained with Cold, than my heart can think, and all other Pains, for which Pains I ſaw, that all is too litle that I can ſay, for it may not be told. The ſhewing of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Pains filled me full of Pains, for I wiſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:204885:30"/> well that he ſuffered but once, but as he would ſhew it me, and fill me with mind, as I had before deſired: And in all this time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> preſence, I felt no Pain but for <hi>Chriſts</hi> Pains.</p>
                  <p>Then thought me, I knew full litle what Pain it was that I asked, and as a Wretch I repented me, thinking if I had wiſt what it had been, loath had me been to have prayed it, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my Pains paſſed any bodily Death. I thought, <hi>Is any Pain in Hell like this?</hi> and I was anſwered in my Reaſon, <hi>Hell is an other Pain, for their is Deſpair; but of all Pains that lead to Salvation, this is the moſt, to ſee the Lover to ſuffer.</hi> How might any Pain be more than to ſee him that is all my Life, all my Bliſs, and all my Joy, ſuffer? Here left I ſtedfaſtly, that I loved <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo much above my ſelf, that there was no Pain that might be ſuffered, like to that ſorrow that I had to ſee him in Pain.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204885:40"/> Will; and for the tender Love that our <hi>good Lord</hi> hath to all that ſhall be ſaved; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth readily and ſweetly, meaning thus: <hi>It is true, that ſin is cauſe of all this Pain; but all ſhall be well, and all manner of thing ſhall be well.</hi> Theſe Words were ſhewed full tenderly, ſhewing no manner of blame to me, ne to none that ſhall be ſafe. Then were it great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs of me to blame or wonder on <hi>God</hi> of my <hi>ſin,</hi> ſithen he blameth not me for <hi>ſin.</hi> And in theſe ſame Words, I ſaw an high marvellous privity hid in <hi>God:</hi> Which privity, he ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly make, and ſhall be known to us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In which knowing we ſhall verily ſee the cauſe why he ſuffered <hi>ſin</hi> to come. In which ſight, we ſhall endleſly have joy.</p>

                  <p>ANd when <hi>God Almighty</hi> had ſhewed ſo plenteouſly, and ſo fully of his Goodneſs, I deſired, to wit, of a certain Creature that I loved, if it ſhould continue in good Living; which I hoped by the Grace of <hi>God</hi> was begun. And in this ſingular deſire, it ſeemed that I let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf; for I was not taught in this time: And then was I anſwered in my Reaſon, as it were by a friendful mean; <hi>Take it generally, and behold the courteſie of thy Lord God, as he ſhewed to thee; for it is more Worſhip to God to behold him in all, than in any ſpecial thing.</hi> I aſſented, and therewith I learned, that it is more Worſhip to <hi>God</hi> to know all thing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, than to like in any thing in ſpecial, and if I ſhould do wiſely after this Teaching. I hold not be glad for any thing in ſpecial, ne greatly diſeaſed for any manner thing, for <hi>All ſhall be well.</hi> For the full-head of joy, is to behold <hi>God</hi> in all; for by the ſame bleſſed Might, Wiſdom, and Love, that he made all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204885:47"/> thing; to the ſame end, our good <hi>Lord</hi> leadeth it continually, and there to himſelf ſhall bring it; and when it is time we ſhall ſee it. And the ground of this was ſhewed in the <hi>firſt,</hi> and more openly in the <hi>third,</hi> where it ſaith; <hi>I ſaw God in a Point:</hi> All that our <hi>Lord</hi> doth, is rightfully, and all that he ſuffereth is Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And in theſe <hi>two</hi> is comprehended Good and Evil; for all that is Good <hi>our Lord</hi> doth, and that is Evil <hi>our Lord</hi> ſuffereth: I ſay not that Evil is Worſhipful, but I ſay the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our <hi>Lord God</hi> is Worſhipful, whereby his Goodneſs ſhall be known without end, and his marvellous Meekneſs and Mild-head by this working of Mercy and Grace. Right <note n="|" place="margin">i e: <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.</hi>
                     </note> full-head is that thing that is ſo good, that it may not be better than it is: For <hi>God</hi> himſelf is very rightful head, and all his Works be done rightfully, as they be ordained fro without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by his high Might, his high Wiſdom, his high Goodneſs. And right, as he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it to the beſt, right ſo he worketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and leadeth it to the ſame end: And he is ever full pleaſed with himſelf, and with all his Works. And the beholding of this bleſſed Accord is full ſweet to the Soul that ſeeth it by Grace: All the Souls that ſhall be ſaved in Heaven without end, be made rightful in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> and by his own Goodneſs. In which rightfullneſs we be endleſly kept, and marvellouſly above all Creatures. And Mercy is a Working that cometh of the Goodneſs of

By his ſufferance we fall; and in his bleſſed Love with his Might, and his Wiſdom we are kept; and by Mercy and Grace we be raiſed to manifold more Joy.

And then ſheweth our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf to the Soul merrily, and of full glad chear, with friendfully welcoming as if it had been in Pain and in Priſon, ſaying thus: <hi>My dear Darling, I am glad thou art come to me in all thy Woe; I have ever been with thee, and now ſeeſt thou me loving, and we be oned in Bliſs.</hi> Thus are ſins forgiven by Grace and Mercy, and our Soul Worſhipfully received in Joy; like as it ſhall be when it cometh into Heaven, as oftimes as it cometh by the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Working of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Paſſion. Here underſtood I verily, that all manner of thing is made ready to us by the great Goodneſs of <hi>God;</hi> ſo far forth, that what time we be our ſelf in Peace and in Charity, we be verily ſafe: But for we may not have this in fullhead while we be here; therefore it befalleth us ever to live in ſweet Praying, and in lovely Longing with our <hi>Lord Jeſu,</hi> for he longeth ever for to bring us to the fulhead of Joy, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid; where he ſheweth the Ghoſtly Thirſt.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204885:53"/> Love that toucheth us all by his bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; the ſame bleſſed Love teacheth us that we ſhall hate ſin only for Love. And I am ſure by my own feeling, the more that each kind Soul ſeeth this in the courteous Love of our <hi>Lord God,</hi> the lother is him to ſin, and the more he is aſhamed: For if it were laid before us all the Pain that is in Hell, and in Purgatory, and in Earth, to ſuffer it rather than ſin, we ſhould rather chooſe all that Pain, than ſin: For ſin is ſo vile, and ſo mickle for to hate, that it may be likned to no Pain; which Pain is not ſin. And to me was ſhewed none harder Hell than ſin; for a kind Soul hateth no Pain but ſin, for all is good but ſin, and naught is evil but ſin. And when we give our intent to Love and Meekneſs, by the working of Mercy and Grace, we be made all Fair and Clean.</p>
                  <p>And as Mighty, and as Wiſe as <hi>God</hi> is to ſave Man, as willing he is: For <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is ground of all the Laws of Chriſten Men; and he taught us to doe Good againſt Evil. Here we may ſee that he is himſelf this Charity, and doth to us as he teacheth us to do: For he will that we be like him in whole-head of endleſs Love to our ſelf, and to our even Chriſten. No more than his Love is broken to us for our ſin, no more will he that our Love be broken to our ſelf, nor to our even Chriſten, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly hate ſin, and endleſly love the Soul, as <hi>God</hi> loveth it: Then ſhould we hate ſin like as

And thus in our feelling, our folly is cauſe of our Weakneſs: For thus have I felt by my ſelf. And all this brought our <hi>Lord</hi> ſuddenly to my mind, and ſhewed theſe Words, and ſaid, <hi>I am ground of thy beſeeking. Firſt, it is my will that thou have it: And ſithen I make thee to will it: And ſithen I make thee to beſeek it, and thou ſeekeſt it: How ſhould it then be, that thou ſhouldeſt not have thy ſeeking?</hi> And thus in the firſt Reaſon, with the three that follow, our good <hi>Lord</hi> ſheweth a mighty Comfort, as it may be ſeen in the ſame Words; and in the firſt Reaſon, there he ſaith; <hi>And thou beſeek</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:204885:54"/> it: There he ſheweth full great pleaſance and endleſs meed, that he will give us for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking.

For of all thing that our good <hi>Lord</hi> maketh us to beſeek himſelf, he hath ordained it to us from without beginning. Here may we then ſee, that our beſeeking is not the cauſe of the Goodneſs, and Grace that he doth to us, but his proper Goodneſs. And that ſhewed he verily in all theſe ſweet Words, there he ſaith, <hi>I am Ground:</hi> And our good <hi>Lord</hi> will that this be known of his Lovers in Earth; and the more that we know, the more ſhall we beſeech, if it be wiſely take; and ſo is our <hi>Lords</hi> meaning. Beſeeching is a true and gracious laſting will of the Soul, owned and faſtened into the Will of our <hi>Lord,</hi> by the ſweet privy Working of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf he is the firſt Receiver of our Prayer, as to my ſight, and he taketh it full thankfully; and highly enjoying, he ſendeth it up above, and ſetteth it in Treaſure, where it ſhall never periſh: It is there before <hi>God,</hi> with all his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Saints</hi> continually received, ever ſpeeding our needs. And when we ſhall undertake our bliſs, it ſhall be given us for a degree of Joy, with endleſs Worſhipful thanking of him; full glad and merry is our <hi>Lord</hi> of our Prayer: and he looketh thereafter, and he will have it; for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204885:54"/> with his Grace it maketh us like to himſelf in condition, as we be in kind; and ſo is his bleſſed Will: For he ſaith thus, <hi>Pray intirely, inwardly, though thee think it ſavour thee not, yet it is profitable enough, though thou feel it nought: Pray intirely, inwardly, though thou feel nought, though thou ſee nought; yea, though thou think thou might not; for in Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Barrenneſs, in Sickneſs, and in Feebleneſs, then is thy Prayer full pleaſant to mee; though thou think at ſavor thee not but litle, and ſo is all thy Living Prayer in my ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the meed and the endleſs thank that he will give us, therefore he is covetuous to have us Praying continually in his ſight. <hi>God</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth the good Will, and the Travel of his Servants, howſoever we feel: Wherefore it pleaſeth him that we work in Prayer, and in good Living, by his Help and his Grace, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably with Diſcretion, keeping our Mights to him; till when we have him that we ſeek in fulhead of joy, that is <hi>Jeſu.</hi> And that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he in the <hi>xvth.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204885:55"/> and he ſhall make it ſo as he ſeeth himſelf; bleſſed mote he be: For this is our <hi>Lords</hi> Will that our Prayer and our truſt be both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like large; for if we truſt not as <note n="*" place="margin">much</note> mickle as we Pray, we do not full Worſhip to our <hi>Lord</hi> in our Prayer. And alſo we tarry and Pain our ſelf; and the cauſe is as I believe, for we know not truly that our <hi>Lord</hi> is Ground in whom that our Prayer ſpringeth. And alſo that we know not that it is given us by Grace of his Love; for if we knew this, it would make us to truſt to have of our <hi>Lords</hi> gift all that we deſire; for I am ſure that no man asketh Mercy and Grace with true meaning, but if Mercy and Grace be firſt given to him. But ſometime it cometh to our mind that we have prayed long time; and yet it thinketh us that we have not our asking: but herefore ſhould we not be heavy; for I am ſure by our <hi>Lords</hi> meaning, that either we abide a better time, or more Grace, or a better Gift. He will that we have true knowing in himſelf that he is being. And in this knowing, he will that our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be grounded with all our Mights, and all our Intents, and all our Meanings: And in this Ground, he will that we take our <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place.</hi>
                     </note> ſteeds, and our dwelling. And by the gracious Light of himſelf, he will that we have underſtanding of <hi>three</hi> things that follow. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, our Noble and Excellent making. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> our precious and dear worthy <note n="*" place="margin">i e: <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
                     </note> again being. The <hi>third,</hi> all thing that he hath made beneath us,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204885:56"/> to ſerve us, and for our Love keepeth it. Then meaneth he thus, as if he ſaid, <hi>Behold and ſee that I have done all this before thy Prayer, and now thou art and prayeſt me.</hi> And thus he meaneth that it longeth to us, to wit, that the greateſt Deeds be done, as <hi>Holy Church</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And in the beholding of this, with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we owe to Pray for the Deed that is now in doing; and that is, that he rule us, and guide us to his Worſhip in this Life, and bring us to his Bliſs; and therefore he hath done all. Then meaneth he thus, that we ſee that he doth it; and we pray therefore, for that one is not enough: for if we pray, and ſee not that he doth it, it maketh us heavy and doubtful, and that is not his Worſhip. And if we ſee that doth it, and we pray not, we do not our duty: And ſo it may not be; that is to ſay, ſo is it not in his beholding. But to ſee that he doth it, and to Pray forthwithall: So is he Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and we ſpeed. All thing that our <hi>Lord</hi> hath ordained to doe, it is his Will that we pray therefore, either in ſpecial or in general. And the joy and the bliſs that is to him, and the Thank and the Worſhip that we ſhall have therefore, it paſſeth the underſtanding of all Creatures in this Life, as to my ſight. For Prayer is a rightwiſe underſtanding of that full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of joy that is for to come, with true longing, and very truſt ſavouring or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our bliſs, that we be ordained to, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh us to long.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204885:56"/> and Love, with ſweet meaning in <hi>our Saviour</hi> graciouſly maketh us to truſt. And thus have we of kind to long, and of Grace to truſt: And in theſe two Workings, our <hi>Lord</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us continually; for it is our duty. And his Goodneſs may no leſs aſſigne in us, that longeth to us, to doe our diligence thereto: And when we do it, yet ſhall us think that it is naught: And true it is, but doe we as we may, and meekly ask Mercy and Grace; and all that us faileth, we ſhall it find in him. And thus meaneth he, there he ſaith, <hi>I am the Ground of thy beſeeching.</hi> And thus in thoſe bleſſedful Words, with the ſhewing, I ſaw a full over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming againſt all our Wickedneſs, and all our doubtful dreeds.</p>

And thus he teacheth us to Pray; and mightily to truſt that we ſhall have it; for he beholdeth us in Love, and will make us Partner of his good Will and Deed: And therefore he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204885:57"/> ſtirreth us to Pray, that that liketh him to do: For which Prayer and good Will that we have of his gift, he will reward us, and give us end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs meed. And this was ſhewed in this Word, <hi>And thou beſeekeſt it.</hi> In this Word <hi>God</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great pleaſance, and ſo great liking, as he were much beholding to us for each good Deed that we do; and yet it is he that doth it: And for that we beſeech him mightily, to do that thing that him liketh; as if he ſaid, <hi>What might thou pleaſe mee more than to beſeech mightily, wiſely, and wilfully, to do that thing that I will have done.</hi> And thus the Soul by Prayer is accorded with <hi>God.</hi> But when our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> of his ſpecial Grace ſheweth himſelf to our Soul, we have that we deſire: And then we ſee not for the time what we ſhould more Pray; but all our intent, with all our Mights is ſet whole into the beholding of him. And this is an high unperceiveable <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as to my ſight; for all the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Prayer, is to be oned in to the ſight and beholding of him, to whom we Pray mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly, enjoying with reverent dreed; and ſo great ſweetneſs, and delight in him, that we can pray right naught, but as he ſtirreth us for the time. And well I wot, the more the Soul ſeeth of <hi>God,</hi> the more ſhe deſireth him by Grace; but when we ſee him not ſo, then feel we need, and cauſe to pray for feeling, and for unableneſs of our ſelf to <hi>Jeſu.</hi> For when a Soul is tempted, troubled, and left to her ſelf

And therefore by this Doome, methought that me behooveth needs to know my ſelf a ſinner: And by the ſame Doome I underſtood, that ſinners be ſometimes worthy blame and Wrath; and theſe two could I not ſee in <hi>God:</hi> And therefore my adviſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was more than I can or may tell; for the <hi>higher</hi> Doome <hi>God</hi> ſheweth himſelf in the ſame time. And therefore me behooved needs to take it: And the <hi>lower</hi> Doome was learned me before time in <hi>Holy Church;</hi> and therefore I might not by no way leave the lower Doome. Then was this my deſire, that I might ſee in <hi>God,</hi> in what manner that the Doome of <hi>Holy Church</hi> here in Earth, is true in his ſight, and how it longeth to me verily to know it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might both be ſaved, ſo as it were

And to all this, I ne had no other anſwer, but a marvellous Example of a Lord, and of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as I ſhall ſay after, and that full miſtely ſhewed: And yet I ſtood in Deſire, and Will, into my lives end, that I might by Grace know theſe two Dooms, as it longeth to me. For all Heavenly things, and all Earthly things that long to Heaven, be comprehended in theſe two Dooms. And the more knowing, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by the gracious leading of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that we have of theſe two Dooms; the more we ſhall ſee and know our feelings <hi>(and Workings of Grace);</hi> and ever the more that we ſee them, the more kindly by Grace, we ſhall long to be fulfilled of endleſs Joy and Bliſs, for we be made thereto.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204885:60"/> it behoveth needs to be, that the nearer we be our bliſs, the more we ſhall long; and that both by Kind and by Grace: We may have knowing of our ſelf in this Life, by continual help and vertue of our high kind; in which knowing, we may encreaſe and wax by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and ſpeeding of Mercy and Grace.

That <hi>other,</hi> was the common teaching of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> of which I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enformed and grounded, and wilfully ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in uſe, and underſtanding. And the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of this came not from me; for by the ſhewing, I was not ſtirred, nor led therefro in no manner Point. But I had therein teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to love it, and like it; whereby I might with the help of our <hi>Lord</hi> and his Grace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and riſe to more Heavenly knowing, and higher loving.

And therefore I took, that the Forgiveneſs of his Wrath ſhould be one of the principal Points of his Mercy. But for ought that I might behold and deſire, I could not ſee this Point in all the ſhewing. But how I ſaw and underſtood of the Working of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; I ſhall ſay ſome deal, as <hi>God</hi> will give me Grace. I underſtood thus; Man is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Life, and by ſimpleneſs and uncun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning falleth into ſin: He is unmighty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of himſelf; and alſo his Will is over-laid.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204885:61"/> In this time he is in Tempeſt, and in Sorrow, and in Woe: And the cauſe is blindneſs, for he ſeeth not <hi>God;</hi> for if he ſaw <hi>God</hi> continually, he ſhould have no miſchievous feeling, ne no manner ſtirring, nor ſorrowing that ſerveth to ſin. Thus ſaw I, and felt in the ſame time; and methought that the ſight and the feeling was high, and plentuous, and gracious, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that our common feeling is in this Life; but yet methought it was but low and ſmall, in regard of the great deſire that the Soul hath to ſee <hi>God:</hi> For I felt in me <hi>five</hi> manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which be theſe; Enjoying, Mourning, Deſire, Dreed, and true Hope. <hi>Enjoying</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> gave me underſtanding, and knowing that it was himſelf that I ſaw <hi>Mourning,</hi> and that was for feeling deſire, that was that I might ſee him for ever more and more; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowing, that we ſhall never have full reſt, till we ſee him clearly and verily in Heaven. <hi>Dreed</hi> was, for it ſeemed to me in all that time, that ſight ſhould fail, and I to be left to my ſelf. <hi>True hope,</hi> was in the endleſs Love that I ſaw, that I ſhould be kept by his Mercy, and brought to the bliſs.

And therefore to the Soul, that of his ſpecial Grace, ſeeth ſo far forth of the high marvellous goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> that we be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly oned to him in Love: It is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that may be, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be Wrath; for Wrath and Friendſhip be <hi>two</hi> Contraries; for he that waſteth and deſtroyeth our Wrath, and maketh us meek and mild; it behooveth us needs to believe, that he be ever in one Love, meek, and mild: Which is contrary to Wrath, for I ſaw full truly, that where our <hi>Lord</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, Peace is taken, and Wrath hath no <note n="*" place="margin">i e: <hi>place</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204885:64"/> the endleſs Goodneſs. For though we feel in us Wrath, Debate, and Strife, yet we be all mercifully becloſed in the midhead of <hi>God,</hi> and in his meekhead, in his benignity, and in his <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                     </note> buxomneſs. For I ſaw full truly, that all our endleſs Friendſhip, our ſteed, our life, and our being is in <hi>God;</hi> for that ſame endleſs Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that keepeth us when we ſin, that we periſh not: That ſame endleſs Goodneſs continually treateth in us a Peace againſt our Wrath, and our contrarious falling, and maketh us to ſee our need, with a true dread mightily to ſeek unto <hi>God</hi> to have Forgiveneſs, with a gracious deſire of our Salvation, for we may not be bliſsfully ſaved, till we be verily in Peace and in Love, for that is our Salvation. And though we be Wrath, and the contrariouſneſs that is in us be now in Tribulation, Diſeaſe, and Woe, as falling into our blindneſs, and our pronity; Yet be we ſure and ſafe by the merciful keeping of <hi>God</hi> that we periſh not; but we be not bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſafe, in having of our endleſs joy, till we be all in Peace and in Love; that is to ſay, full pleaſed with <hi>God,</hi> and with all his Works, and with all his Dooms; and loving and pleaſable with our ſelves, and with our even Chriſten, and with all that <hi>God</hi> loveth, as love liketh. And this doth <hi>Gods</hi> Goodneſs in us. Thus ſaw I that <hi>God</hi> is our very Peace; and he is our ſure Keeper, when we be our ſelf at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace; and he continually worketh to bring us into endleſs Peace: And thus when by the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204885:64"/> working of mercy and grace we be made meek and mild, than we be full ſafe. Suddenly is the Soul oned to <hi>God,</hi> when ſhe is truly peaced in her ſelf; for in him is found no Wrath. And thus I ſaw when we be all in Peace and in Love, we find no contrariouſneſs in no manner of letting.

And between theſe two contraries, my Reaſon was greatly travelled by my blindneſs, and could have no reſt, for dread that his bleſſed Preſence ſhould paſs from my ſight, and I to be left in unknowing how he behold us in our ſin; for either me behooved to ſee in <hi>God</hi> that ſin were all done away, or elſe me behooved to ſee in <hi>God</hi> how he ſeeth it; whereby I might truly know how it longeth to mee to ſee ſin, and the manner of our blame.

In which Woe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>ſeven</hi> great Pains. The <hi>firſt</hi> was the ſore bruſing that he took in his falling, which was to him much pain. The <hi>ſecond</hi> was the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his body. The <hi>third</hi> was feebleneſs that followed of theſe two. The <hi>fourth</hi> was, that hew as blinded in his Reaſon, &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi>
                     </note> ſtonnyed in his mind, ſo farth forth, that almoſt he had forgotten his own Love. The <hi>fifth</hi> was, that he might not riſe. The <hi>ſixth</hi> was pain moſt marvellous to me; and that was that he lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. I looked all about and beheld, and far,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204885:66"/> ne near, ne high, ne low; I ſaw to him no help. The <hi>ſeventh</hi> was, that the place that he lay in, was long, hard, and grievous. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled how this Servant might thus meekly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all this Woe. And I beheld with aviſement, to wit, if I could perceive in him any default; or if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould aſſign him any manner of blame. And verily there was none ſeen; for only his good will and his great deſire was the cauſe of his falling. And he was as unlothful, and as good inwardly as he was when he ſtood before his <hi>Lord,</hi> ready to do his Will. And right thus continually, his loving <hi>Lord</hi> full tenderly beholdeth him; and now with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chear: <hi>One outward</hi> full meekly and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with great rewth and pity; and this was of the <hi>firſt. Another inward</hi> more Ghoſtly: And this was ſhewed with a leading of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding into the <hi>Lord</hi> in reſtoring, which I ſaw him highly enjoy for the worſhipful reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and noble that he will, and ſhall bring his Servant to by his plentuous Grace; and this was of <hi>the other</hi> ſhewing. And now was my underſtanding led again into the <hi>firſt,</hi> both keeping in mind: Then ſaid this courteous <hi>Lord</hi> in his meaning: <hi>To my beloved Servant, what harm and diſeaſe he hath had, and taken in my ſervice for my love, yea, and for his good will? It is not reaſon that I reward him, his</hi> 
                     <note n="|" place="margin">ie. <hi>fright</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>frey and his dreed, his hurt and his maym, and all his Woe? and not only this, but falleth it not to me to give him a gift, that be better to him, and</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:204885:67"/> 
                     <hi>more worſhipful than his own heal ſhould have been; or elſe methinketh I did him no Grace.</hi> And in this, an inward Ghoſtly ſhewing of the <hi>Lords</hi> meaning deſcended into my Soul, in which I ſaw, that it behooved needs to be ſtanding his great goodneſs and his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that his dear worthy Servant which he loved ſo much, ſhould be highly and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rewarded without end, above that he ſhould have been if he had not fallen; yea, and ſo far forth, that his falling and all his Woe that he hath taken thereby, ſhall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the high over-paſſing Worſhip and endleſs Bliſs: And at this Point, the ſhewing of the example vaniſhed, and our <hi>good Lord</hi> led forth my underſtanding, in ſight and in ſhewing of the Revelation to the end. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this forth leading, the marvelling of the example went never from me; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought it was given me for anſwer to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: And yet could I not take therein full un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to my eaſe in that time; for in the ſervant that was ſhewed for <hi>Adam;</hi> as I ſhall ſay, I ſaw many divers properties that might by no manner be direct to ſingle <hi>Adam.</hi> And thus in that time I ſtood mickle in <hi>three</hi> Knowings; for the full underſtanding of this marvellous Example was not given me in that time. In which miſty Example, the privities of the Revelation be yet much hid. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, I ſaw and underſtood that every ſhewing is full of privities: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204885:67"/> me behooveth now to tell <hi>three</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which I am <note n="*" place="margin">i e <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>ſomedeal</hi> eaſed. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, the beginning of teaching that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood there in the ſame time. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, the inward Learning that I have underſtood therein ſithens. The <hi>third</hi> is, all the holy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> from the beginning to the end, which our <hi>Lord God</hi> of his Goodneſs bringeth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times freely to the ſight of my underſtanding. And theſe <hi>three</hi> be ſo oned as to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I cannot, nor may depart them. And by theſe <hi>three</hi> as one, I have teaching where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>ought</hi>
                     </note> owe to believe and truſt in our <hi>Lord God,</hi> that of the ſame Goodneſs that he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and for the ſame end, right ſo of the ſame goodneſs and of the ſame end; he ſhall declare it to us when it is his Will; for <hi>twenty years</hi> after the time of the ſhewing, ſave <hi>three</hi> months I had teaching inwardly, as I ſhall ſay. It longeth to thee to take heed to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and the conditions that were ſhewed in the Example, though thee think that it be miſty and indifferent to thy ſight. I aſſented wilfully with great deſire, ſeeing inwardly with aviſement all the points and the properties that were ſhewed in the ſame time, as far forth as my Wit and my underſtanding will ſerve; beginning at my beholding at the <hi>Lord</hi> and at the <hi>Servant:</hi> At the manner of ſitting of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the place he ſat on; and the colour of his Cloathing; and the manner of ſhape; and his chear without, and his nobley, and his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204885:68"/> goodneſs within: And the manner of ſtanding of the <hi>Servant;</hi> and the place where, and how: and his manner of Cloathing, the Colour; and the ſhape at his outward behaviour; and at his inward goodneſs, and his unlothfulneſs. The <hi>Lord,</hi> that ſat ſolemnly in reſt and in peace, I underſtand that he is <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Servant</hi> that ſtood before him, I underſtood that he was ſhewed for <hi>Adam;</hi> that is to ſay, one man was ſhewed that time, and his falling, to make thereby to be underſtood how <hi>God</hi> beholdeth all man and his falling: For in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> all man is one man, and one man is all man. This man was hurt in his Might, and made full feeble. And he was ſtonnyed in his underſtanding; for he was turned from the beholding of his <hi>Lord,</hi> but his Will was kept in <hi>Gods</hi> ſight: for his Will I ſaw our <hi>Lord</hi> commend and approve, but himſelf was letted and blinded of the knowing of this Will: And this is to him great ſorrow, and grievous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; for neither he ſeeth clearly his loving <hi>Lord,</hi> which is to him full meek and mild; nor he ſeeth truly what himſelf is in the ſight of his loving <hi>Lord.</hi> And well I wot, that when theſe two be wiſely and truly ſeen, we ſhall get reſt and peace here in party. And the <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                     </note> fulſomneſs in the bliſs in Heaven by his plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Grace: And this was a beginning of teaching which I ſaw in the ſame time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I might come to knowing, in what manner he beholdeth us in our ſin. And then I ſaw
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204885:68"/> that only pain blameth and puniſheth. And our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> comforteth and ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And ever he is to the Soul in glad chear, longing and loving to bring us to his bliſs. The place that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſat on was ſimple, on the Earth barren and deſert, alone in Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; his Cloathing was wide and ſide, and full ſeemly, as falleth to a <hi>Lord:</hi> The colour of the cloathing was Blew as Azure, moſt ſad and fair; his chear was merciful: The colour of his Face was fair, brown, white, with full ſeemly Countenance; his eyen were black, moſt fair and ſeemly, ſhewing full of lovely pity. And within him an heyward long and broad, all full of endleſs Heavenlineſs: And the lovely looking that he looked on his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant continually; and namely, in his falling; methought it might melt our Hearts for love, and burſt them in two for joy. This fair look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewed of a ſeemly <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </note> medelur, which was marvellous to behold. That <hi>one</hi> was rewth and pity: That <hi>other</hi> joy and bliſs: The joy and bliſs paſſeth as far the ruth and the pity, as Heaven is above Earth: the pity was Earthly, and the bliſs Heavenly. The rewth and the pity of the <hi>Father</hi> was of the falling of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is his moſt loved Creature: The joy and the bliſs was of the falling of his dear wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Son,</hi> which is <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</hi>
                     </note> even with the <hi>Father.</hi> The merciful beholding of his lovely chear, fufilled all Earth, and deſcended down with <hi>Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell; with which continuant pity, <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:204885:69"/> was kept fro endleſs Death. And this Mercy and Pity dwelleth with mankind, into the time that we come up into Heaven. But man is blinded in this Life, and therefore, we may not ſee <hi>our Father God</hi> as he is. And what time that he of his Goodneſs will ſhew him to man, he ſheweth him <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>friendly.</hi>
                     </note> homely as may, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that I ſaw verily, we ought to know and believe, that the <hi>Father</hi> is not man. But his ſitting on the Earth barren and deſert, is this to mean: He made mans Soul to be his own City, and his dwelling Place; which is moſt pleaſing to him of all his Works. And what time Man was fallen, into ſorrow and pain; he was not all ſeemly to ſerve of that Noble Office. And therefore our kind <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> would have <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned for him.</hi>
                     </note> dight him none other place, but to ſit upon the Earth; abiding mankind, which is <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>mingled.</hi>
                     </note> medled with Earth: Till what time by his Grace, his dear worthy <hi>Son</hi> had brought again his City into the noble fairneſs, with his hard travel. The <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                     </note> blewhead of that cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betokeneth his ſtedfaſtneſs: The <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>brownneſs</hi>
                     </note> brown-head of his fair face, with the ſeemly <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>blackneſs</hi>
                     </note> black-head of the eyen, was moſt according to ſhew his holy Soberneſs. The largeneſs of his cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was fair flaming about, betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath becloſed in him all heavineſs, and all endleſs joy and bliſs. And this was ſhewed in a touch; where I ſaw that my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was led into the <hi>Lord,</hi> in which I ſaw him highly <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi>
                     </note> enjoy, for the worſhipful
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204885:69"/> reſtoring, that he will and ſhall bring his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to by his plentious Grace. And yet I marvelled, beholding the <hi>Lord</hi> and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant before ſaid: I ſaw the <hi>Lord</hi> ſit ſolemnly, and the Servant ſtanding reverently before his <hi>Lord:</hi> In which Servant is <hi>double</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>one</hi> without, an <hi>other</hi> within; outward he was clad ſimple, as a Labourer which was diſpoſed to travel, and he ſtood full near the <hi>Lord,</hi> not even fore anenſt him; but in party aſide, and that on the left ſide. His cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a white Kirtle, ſingle, old, and all defaulted, dyed with ſweat of his body; ſtreit ſitting to him, and ſhort as it were an handful beneath the knee; bare, ſeeming as it ſhould ſoon be worn up, ready to be ragged and rent. And in this I marvelled greatly, thinking, this is now an unſeemly cloathing for the Servant that is ſo highly loved, to ſtand in before ſo Worſhipful a <hi>Lord.</hi> And inward in him was ſhewed a ground of Love; which Love, he had to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven like to the Love that the <hi>Lord</hi> had to him. The Wiſdom of the Servant ſaw inwardly, that there was one thing to do, which ſhould be Worſhip to the <hi>Lord.</hi> And the Servant for Love, having no regard to himſelf, nor to nothing that might fall off him, haſtily did ſtart and run at the ſending of his <hi>Lord,</hi> to do that thing which was his Will and his Worſhip; For it ſeemed by his outward cloathing, as if he had been a continuant Labourer, and an
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204885:70"/> hard traveller of long time. And by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſight that I had, both in the <hi>Lord</hi> and in the Servant, it ſeemed that he was anaved; that is to ſay, new beginning for to travel; which Servant was never ſent out before. There was a Treaſure in the Earth which the <hi>Lord</hi> loved; I marvelled and thought what it might be: And I was anſwered in my underſtanding, it is a meat which is loveſome and pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Lord:</hi> For I ſaw the <hi>Lord</hi> ſit as a man, and I ſaw neither meat nor drink wherewith to ſerve him; this was <hi>one</hi> marvel. <hi>Another</hi> marvel was, that this ſolemn <hi>Lord</hi> had no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant but one, and him he ſent out: I beheld, thinking what Labour it may be that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould do; and then I underſtood that he ſhould do the greateſt Labour, and the hardeſt Travel; that is, he ſhould be a Gardner, del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>ditching.</hi>
                     </note> diking, and ſweating, and turning the Earth up and down, and ſeek the deepneſs, and water the Plants in time: And in this he ſhould continue his Travel, and make ſweat-floods to run, and noble plentuouſneſs Fruit to ſpring, which he ſhould bring before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſerve him therewith to his liking; and he ſhould never turn again, till he had dight this meat all ready, as he knew that it liked to the <hi>Lord:</hi> And then he ſhould take this meat, with the drink, and bear it full Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the <hi>Lord.</hi> And all this time the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould ſit right on the ſame place, abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Servant whom he ſent out: And yet I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:204885:70"/> marvelled fro whence the Servant came: For I ſaw in the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he hath within himſelf endleſs Life, and all manner of Goodneſs, ſave the treaſure that was in the Earth: And that was grounded within the <hi>Lord</hi> in marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deepneſs of endleſs Love. But it was not all to his Worſhip, till his Servant hath thus nobly <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>dreſt</hi>
                     </note> dight it, and brought it before him in himſelf preſent. And without the <hi>Lord</hi> was right nought but Wilderneſs. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not all what this Example meant; and therefore I marvelled from whence the Servant came: In the Servant is comprehended <hi>the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity;</hi> and in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is comprehended <hi>Adam;</hi> that is to ſay, all men. And therefore when I ſay the <hi>Son,</hi> it meaneth, the <hi>God-head,</hi> which is even with the <hi>Father.</hi> And when I ſaw the Servant, it meaneth <hi>Chriſts</hi> Manhood, which is <hi>rightful Adam.</hi> By the nearhood of the Servant, is underſtood the <hi>Son;</hi> And by the ſtanding on the left ſide is underſtood <hi>Adam.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>God the Father:</hi> The <hi>Servant</hi> is the <hi>Son, Jeſu Chriſt:</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the even Love that is in them both. When <hi>Adam</hi> fell, <hi>Gods Son</hi> fell for the right oning which was made in Heaven; <hi>Gods Son</hi> might not be ſeparate from <hi>Adam,</hi> for by <hi>Adam</hi> I underſtand all man: <hi>Adam</hi> fell fro Life to Death into the ſlade of this wretched World; and after that into Hell. <hi>Gods Son</hi> fell with <hi>Adam</hi> into the ſlade of the Maidens Womb; which was the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204885:71"/> faireſt Daughter of <hi>Adam;</hi> and that was for to excuſe <hi>Adam</hi> from blame in Heaven and in Earth. And mightily he fetched him out of Hell. By the Wiſdom and the Goodneſs that was in the Servant, is underſtood <hi>Gods Son;</hi> by the poor cloathing as a Labourer ſtanding near the left ſide, is underſtood the manhood of <hi>Adam,</hi> with all the miſchief and feebleneſs that followeth: For in all this our <hi>good Lord</hi> ſhewed his own <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> but one man. The Vertue and the Goodneſs that we have, is of <hi>Jeſu Chriſt.</hi> The feebleneſs and blindneſs that we have, is of <hi>Adam;</hi> which <hi>two</hi> were ſhewed in the Servant: And thus hath our good <hi>Lord Jeſu</hi> taken upon him all our blame. And therefore our <hi>Father</hi> may nor will no more blame, aſſigne to us, than to his own dear worthy <hi>Son Jeſu Chriſt.</hi> Thus was he the Servant before his coming into the Earth; ſtanding ready before the <hi>Father</hi> in purpoſe, till what time he would ſend him to do the worſhipful deed; by which Mankind was brought again into Heaven; that is to ſay, notwithſtanding that he is <hi>God</hi> even with the <hi>Father,</hi> as anenſt the God-head: But in his fore-ſeeing purpoſe that he would be Man, to ſave Man in fulfilling of the Will of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> ſo he ſtood before his <hi>Father</hi> as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, wilfully taking upon him all our charge. And then he ſtart full readily at the <hi>Fathers</hi> Will; and anon he fell full low in the Maidens Womb, having no regard to himſelf, ne to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204885:71"/> his hard Pains. The white Kirtle is the fleſh: The ſingle-head is, that there was right nought between the God-head and the Man-hood: The ſtraitneſs is Poverty; the old is of <hi>Adams</hi> Wearing; the defaulting is the ſweat of <hi>Adams</hi> travel; the ſhortneſs ſheweth the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-Labourer. And thus I ſaw the <hi>Son</hi> ſtand, ſaying in his meaning: <hi>Loe my dear Father, I ſtand before thee in</hi> Adams <hi>Kirtle, all ready to ſtart and to run; I would be in the Earth to thy Worſhip when it is thy Will to ſend me, how long ſhall I deſire it?</hi> Full truly <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>knew</hi>
                     </note> wiſt the <hi>Son</hi> when it was the <hi>Fathers</hi> Will; and how long he ſhould deſire; that is to ſay, as anenſt the <hi>God-head,</hi> for he is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> Wherefore this meaning was ſhewed in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Manhood of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For all Mankind that ſhall be ſaved, by the ſweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all is the Manhood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for he is the Head, and we be his Members: To which Members the day and the time is unknown, when every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Woe and Sorrow ſhall have an end, and the everlaſting Joy and Bliſs ſhall be fulfilled. Which day and time for to ſee all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Heaven longeth and deſireth; and all that be under Heaven, which ſhall come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their way is by longing and deſiring: Which deſiring and longing was ſhewed in the Servant ſtanding before the <hi>Lord;</hi> or elſe thus, in the <hi>Son</hi> ſtanding before the <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> Kirtle: For the longing and deſiring
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204885:72"/> of all Mankind that ſhall be ſafe appeared in <hi>Jeſu;</hi> for <hi>Jeſu</hi> is in all that <hi>may</hi> be ſafe, and all that be ſaved is in <hi>Jeſu.</hi> And all of the Charity of <hi>God,</hi> with obedience, meekneſs, and patience, and vertues that longeth to us. Alſo in this marvellous Example, I have teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within me, as it were the beginning of an A. B. C. whereby I may have ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our <hi>Lords</hi> meaning: For the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Revelation be hid therein; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that all the ſhewings be full of privities. The ſitting of the <hi>Father</hi> betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>God-head;</hi> that is to ſay, for ſhewing of Reſt and Peace: For in the <hi>God-head</hi> may be no travel. And that he ſheweth himſelf as <hi>Lord,</hi> betokeneth to our Manhood: The ſtanding of the Servant betokeneth travel: and on the left ſide betokeneth, that he was not all worthy to ſtand even right before the <hi>Lord.</hi> His ſtarting was the <hi>God-head,</hi> and the running was the Man-head; for the <hi>God-head</hi> ſtart fro the <hi>Father</hi> into the Maidens Womb, falling into the taking of our kind. And in this falling he took great ſore: The ſore that he took was our fleſh, in which as ſoon as he took it, he had feeling of deadly Pains. By that he ſtood dreadfull before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not even right, betokeneth that his cloathing was not honeſt to ſtand even right before the <hi>Lord;</hi> nor that might not, nor ſhould not be his Office, whiles he was a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer; nor alſo he might not ſit with the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204885:72"/> 
                     <hi>Lord</hi> in reſt and peace, till he had won his peace rightfully with his hard travel. And by the left ſide that the Father left his own Son wilfully in the manhood, to ſuffer all mans pain without ſparing of him. By that his Kirtle was at the point to be ragged and rent; is underſtood the Roddes and Scourges, the Thornes and the Nails; the drawing and the dragging, his tender fleſh renting, as I ſaw in ſome part, the tender fleſh was rent from the head-pann, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on pieces, unto the time the bleeding fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And then it began to dry again, cleaving to the bone. And by the wallowing, and writhing, groaning, and mourning, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he might never riſe all mightily fro that time that he was fallen into the Maidens Womb, till his body was ſlain and dead, he yielding the Soul into the <hi>Fathers</hi> hand, with all mankind for whom he was ſent. And at this point he began firſt to ſhew his might: for then he went into <hi>Hell.</hi> And when he was there, then he raiſed up the great root out of the deep deepneſs, which rightfully was knit to him in high Heaven.

                     </note> medelour, which is ſo marvellous that I can it no deſcrie, for it is all of very Worſhip. Now ſitteth not the <hi>Lord</hi> on Earth in Wilderneſs, but he ſitteth on his rich and noble Seat which he made in Heaven moſt to his liking. Now ſtandeth not the <hi>Son</hi> before the <hi>Father,</hi> as a Servant before the <hi>Lord,</hi> dreadfully cloathed in party naked: but he ſtandeth before the <hi>Father</hi> even right richly cloathed, in bliſsful largeneſs with a Crown upon his head of precious richneſs: For it was ſhewed that we be his Crown: Which Crown is the <hi>Fathers</hi> joy, the <hi>Sons</hi> Worſhip, the <hi>Holy Ghoſts</hi> liking: And endleſs marvellous bliſs to all that be in Heaven. Now ſtandeth not the <hi>Son</hi> before the <hi>Father</hi> on the left ſide as a Labourer; but he ſitteth on the <hi>Fathers</hi> right hand in endleſs reſt and peace. But it is not meant that the <hi>Son</hi> ſitteth on the right hand beſide, as one man ſitteth by another in this Life: For there is no ſuch ſitting as to my ſight in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> but he ſitteth on his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> right hand; that is to ſay, right in the higheſt nobility of the <hi>Fathers</hi> joy.

For it longeth to man meekly to accuſe himſelf; and it longeth to the proper Goodneſs of our <hi>Lord God</hi> courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excuſe man.

And right thus will our good <hi>Lord</hi> that we accuſe our ſelf wilfully, and truly ſee and know his everlaſting Love that he hath to us, and his plentuous Mercy.

That other chear was ſhewed inward; and that was more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and all one: For the Life and the Vertue that we have in the lower party is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And it cometh down to us of the kind Love, of the ſelf by Grace. Between that one and that other is right naught; for it all is one Love: Which one bleſſed Love hath now in us double Working; for in the <hi>lower party</hi> be Pains and Paſſions, Ruths and Pities, Mercies and Forgiveneſs, and ſuch other which be profitable. But in the <hi>higher party</hi> be none of theſe; but all one high Love and marvellous joy: In which marvellous joy all Pains be wholly deſtroyed. And in this not only our good <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed our excuſing; but alſo the worſhipful nobility that he ſhall bring us to, turning all our blame into endleſs Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

And theſe two parties were in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the higher and the lower, which is but one Soul: The <hi>higher party</hi> was ever in peace with <hi>God</hi> in full joy and bliſs: The <hi>lower party,</hi> which is ſenſuality, ſuffered for the Salvation of mankind. And theſe two parties were ſeen and felt in the <hi>viijth. Shewing;</hi> in which my body was fulfilled of feeling, and mind of <hi>Chriſts Paſſion,</hi> and his dying. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, with this was a ſubtile feeling and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy inward ſight of the high parts. And that was ſhewed in the ſame time, where I might not for the mean profer look up into Heaven: And that was for that each mighty beholding of the inward Life: Which inward Life is that high ſubſtance that precious Soul which is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enjoying in the <hi>God-head.</hi>

                  <p>ANd thus I ſaw full ſurely that it is ready to us, and more eaſie, to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>God,</hi> than to know our own Soul. For our Soul is ſo deep grounded in <hi>God,</hi> and ſo endleſly treaſured, that we may not come to the knowing thereof, till we have firſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>God;</hi> which is the Maker to whom it is oned. But notwithſtanding, I ſaw that we have kindly of fulhead to deſire wiſely and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know our own Soul, whereby we be learned to ſeek it <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>where.</hi>
                     </note> there it is, and that is into <hi>God.</hi> And thus by the gracious leading of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> we ſhall know him both in one. Whether we be ſtirred to know <hi>God</hi> or our Soul, it is both good and true. <hi>God</hi> is more nearer to us than our own Soul; for he is ground in whom our Soul ſtandeth, and he is mean that keepeth the ſubſtance and the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality together, ſo that it ſhall never depart: For our Soul ſitteth in <hi>God</hi> in very reſt, and our Soul ſtandeth in <hi>God</hi> in ſure ſtrength: And our Soul is kindly rooted in <hi>God</hi> in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Love. And therefore if we will have knowing of our Soul, and commoning, and daliance therewith, it behooveth to ſeek into our <hi>Lord God,</hi> in whom it is incloſed. And of this encloſing, I ſaw and underſtood more
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204885:80"/> in the <hi>xvjth</hi> Shewing, as I ſhall ſay. And as aneinſt our ſubſtance it may rightly be called our Soul: And aneinſt our ſenſuality it may rightly be called our Soul; and that is by the oning that it hath in <hi>God.</hi> That worſhipful City that our <hi>Lord Jeſu</hi> ſitteth in it is our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality in which he is encloſed. And our kindly ſubſtance is becloſed in <hi>Jeſu,</hi> with the bleſſed Soul of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſitting in reſt in the <hi>God-head.</hi> And I ſaw full ſurely that it behooveth needs to be, that we ſhould be in longing, and in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, into the time that we be led ſo deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God;</hi> that we verily and truly know our own Soul. And ſurely I ſaw, that into this high deepneſs our good <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf leadeth us in the ſame Love that he made us, and in the ſame Love he bought us by Mercy and Grace, through vertue of his bleſſed Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and notwithſtanding all this, we may never come to the full knowing of <hi>God,</hi> till we know firſt clearly our own Soul; for into the time that it is in the full mights, we may not be all holy; and that is, that our ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the vertue of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Paſſion, be brought up into the ſubſtance, with all the profits of our tribulation that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall make us to get by Mercy and Grace. I had in party touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is grounded in kind; that is to ſay, our reaſon is grounded in <hi>God,</hi> which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancially kindneſs. Of this ſubſtancial kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mercy and Grace ſpringeth, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into us, working all things in fulfilling of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:204885:81"/> our joy. Theſe be our grounds in which we have our being, our encreaſe, and our fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; for in kind, we have our Life and our Being, and in Mercy and Grace, we have our encreaſe and our fulfilling. It be <hi>three</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in one goodneſs: And where that one worketh all worken in the thing that belongen to us. <hi>God</hi> will we underſtand, deſiring with all our heart, and with all our ſtrength, to have knowing of them ever more and more, into the time that we be fulfilled: For fully to know them, and clearly to ſee them is <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>naught.</hi>
                     </note> not elſe but endleſs joy and bliſs that we ſhall have in Heaven, which <hi>God</hi> will we begin here in knowing of his Love; for only by our reaſon we may not profit: But if we have evenly therewith mind and Love: ne only in our kindly ground that we have in <hi>God,</hi> we may not be ſaved, but if we have, coming of the ſame ground, Mercy and Grace. For of theſe three Workings, altogether we receive all our goods; of which, the firſt be goods of kind. For in our firſt making, <hi>God</hi> gave us as much good, and as great good, as we might receive only in our ſpirit: But his fore-ſeeing purpoſe in his endleſs Wiſdom, would that we were double.</p>

                  <p>ANd againſt our ſubſtance, he made us ſo noble, and ſo rich, that evermore we work his Will and his Worſhip; there I ſay, <hi>We,</hi> it meaneth man that ſhall be ſaved. For truly I ſaw that we be that he loveth, and do that him liketh, laſtingly without any ſtinting. And of this, great riches; and of this, high noble vertues by meaſure come to our Soul, what time that it is knit to our body: In which knitting we be made ſenſual. And thus in our ſubſtance we be full, and in our ſenſuality we fail; which failing <hi>God</hi> will reſtore and fulfill by working of Mercy and Grace, plenteouſly flowing into us of his own kind goodneſs. And thus this kind goodneſs maketh that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace worketh in us. And the kind goodneſs that we have of him, ableth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the working of Mercy: and Grace. I ſaw that our kind is in <hi>God</hi> whole; in which he maketh diverſities flowing out of him to work his will; whoſe kind keepeth, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace reſtoreth and fulfilleth. And of theſe none ſhall be periſhed; for our kind which is the higher party, is knit to <hi>God</hi> in the making, and <hi>God</hi> is knit to our kind, which is the lower party in our fleſh taking. And thus in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our two kinds be oned: For the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:204885:82"/> is comprehended in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom our higher party is grounded and rooted; and our lower party the ſecond perſon hath taken, which kind firſt to him was a dight. For I ſaw full truly, that all the Works that <hi>God</hi> hath done, or ever ſhall, were full known to him, and before ſeen fro without beginning. And for Love he made mankind; and for the ſame Love himſelf would become Man. The next good that we receive is our <hi>Faith,</hi> in which our profiting beginneth; and it becometh of the high riches of our kind ſubſtance into our ſenſual Soul; and it is grounded in us, and we in that, through the kind goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> by the working of Mercy and Grace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of come all our goods, by which we be led and ſaved; for the Commandements of <hi>God</hi> come therein: In which we owe to have <hi>two</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of underſtanding: <hi>That one</hi> is, that we owe to underſtand and know which be his bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to love them, and to keep them. <hi>That other</hi> is, that we owe to know his forbiddings, to hate them, and to refuſe them: for in theſe two is all our working comprehended. Alſo in our Faith come the <hi>Seven Sacraments,</hi> each following other in order as <hi>God</hi> hath ordained them to us, and all manner vertues; for the ſame vertues that we have received of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance given to us in kind of the Goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> the ſame vertues by the working of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be given to us in Grace through the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> renewed: Which vertues and gifts are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204885:82"/> treaſured to us in <hi>Jeſu Chriſt;</hi> for in that ſame time that <hi>God</hi> knit him to our body in the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Womb, he took our ſenſual Soul. In which taking he, us all having becloſed in him, he oned it to our ſubſtance. In which oning he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> having knit in him all man that ſhall be ſaved, is perfect man. Thus <hi>our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> is our <hi>Mother,</hi> in whom we be all becloſed, and of her born in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for ſhe that is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> is Mother of all that be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>our Saviour.</hi> And our Saviour is our very Mother, in whom we be endleſly born, and never ſhall come out of him. Plentuouſly, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſweetly was this ſhewed: And it is ſpoken of in the <hi>firſt,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>We be all in him becloſed, and he is becloſed in us.</hi> And that is ſpoken of in the <hi>xvjth.

In which working he will we be his helpers, giving to him all our intent, learning his Laws, keeping his lore, deſiring that all bedone that he doth, truly truſting in him; for verily I ſaw that all our ſubſtance is in <hi>God.</hi>

And in our making he knit us, and oned us to himſelf: By which oning, we be kept as clean, and as noble as we were made; by the vertue of that each precious oning, we love our Maker, and like him, praiſe him, and thank him, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly enjoy in him.

And in the <hi>ſecond Perſon,</hi> in Wit and Wiſdom we have our keeping: And aneynſt our ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our reſtoring, and our ſaving; for he is our <hi>Mother, Brother,</hi> and <hi>Saviour.</hi> And in our good <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> we have our rewarding, and our yielding for our living and our travel, and endleſly over-paſſing all that we deſire in his marvellous courteſie of his high plentuous Grace; for all our Life is in <hi>three:</hi> In the <hi>firſt</hi> our being: And in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> we have our encreaſing: And in the <hi>third,</hi> we have our fulfilling. The <hi>firſt</hi> is kind; the <hi>ſecond</hi> is Mercy; the <hi>third</hi> is Grace.

Our ſubſtance is the higher party which we have in our <hi>Father God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:</hi> And the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:204885:84"/> is our <hi>Mother</hi> in kind, in our ſubſtancial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in whom we be grounded and rooted: And he is our <hi>Mother</hi> of Mercy, in our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality taking. And thus our <hi>Mother</hi> is to us diverſe manner working, in whom our parts be kept undeparted: For in our Mother <hi>Chriſt</hi> we profit and encreaſe; and in Mercy he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth us and reſtoreth. And by the vertue of his Paſſion, his Death, and his Upriſing oned us to our ſubſtance.

Our kind <hi>Mother,</hi> our gracious <hi>Mother;</hi> for he would all whole become our <hi>Mother</hi> in all thing; he took the ground of his Work full low, and full mildly in the Maidens Womb.

Wherefore him behooveth to find us, for the dear worthy Love of Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood hath made him debtor to us.

And ſo meant he in theſe bleſſed Words, where he ſaid, <hi>I it am that Holy Church preacheth thee, and teacheth thee;</hi> that is to ſay, all the Health and the Life of the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> all the Vertue and the Grace of my Word; all the goodneſs that is ordained in <hi>Holy Church</hi> to thee; <hi>I it am.</hi> The Mother may lay her Child tenderly to her Breaſt; but our tender <hi>Mother Jeſu</hi> he may homely lead us into his bleſſed Breaſt by his ſweet open ſide, and ſhew us there in party of the <hi>God-head,</hi> and the joyes of Heaven, with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204885:87"/> Ghoſtly ſureneſs of endleſs bliſs. And that ſhewed he in the <hi>jxth. Revelation,</hi> giving the ſame underſtanding in this ſweet Word, where he ſaith, <hi>Loe how I love thee;</hi> behold into his bleſſed ſide enjoying. This fair lovely Word, <hi>Mother,</hi> it is ſo ſweet and ſo kind in it ſelf, that it may not verily be ſaid of none, ne to none but of him, and to him, that is very Mother of Life and of all. To the property of <hi>Mother-head</hi> longeth kind Love, Wiſdom, and Knowing; and it is <hi>God:</hi> For though it be ſo, that our bodily forth-bringing be but little, low, and ſimple, in regard of our Ghoſtly forth-bringing, yet it is he that doth it in the Creatures, by whom that it is done. The kind loving Mother that wotteth; and knoweth the need of her Child, ſhe keepeth it full ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, as the kind and condition of Mother-head will; and ever as it waxeth in Age and in Stature, ſhe changeth the Works, but not her Love: And when it is waxed of more Age, ſhe ſuffereth that it be chaſtiſed; in breaking down of Vices, to make the Child receive Vertues and Grace. This Working with all that be fair and good, our <hi>Lord</hi> doth it in him by whom it is done. Thus he is our Mother in kind by the working of Grace in the lower party, for love of the higher. And he will that we know it; for he will have all our Love faſtned to him. And in this I ſaw that all debt that we owe by <hi>Gods</hi> bidding to Father-head and Mother-head, is fulfilled in true loving of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204885:87"/> 
                     <hi>God:</hi> Which bleſſed Love <hi>Chriſt</hi> worketh in us. And this was ſhewed in all; And Namely, in the High plentuous Words, where he ſaith; <hi>I it am that thou Loveſt.</hi>

                     </note> kind to hate ſin.

Thus is <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of one accord; for Grace is <hi>God,</hi> as unmade kind is <hi>God:</hi> He is two in manner working, and one in Love. And neither of them worketh without other, ne none be departed.

And that ſhewed he where he gave the underſtanding of the Ghoſtly thirſt; that is, the Love-longing that ſhall laſt till Doomes-day. Thus in our very <hi>Mother Jeſu</hi> our Life is grounded in the fore-ſeeing wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of himſelf fro without beginning, with the high might of the <hi>Father,</hi> and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign goodneſs of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And in the taking of our kind he quicked us; and in his bleſſed dying upon the Croſs he bare us to endleſs Life.

Afore this time I had great longing and deſire of <hi>Gods</hi> gift to be delivered of this World, and of this Life; for oft-times I beheld the Woe that is here, and the weal and the bleſſed being that is there. And if there had no pain been in this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204885:92"/> Life, but the abſence of our <hi>Lord,</hi> methought ſometime that it was more than I might bear. And this made me to mourn and buſily to long. And alſo of my own wretchedneſs, ſlouth and wearineſs that me liked, not to live and to travel as me fell to do. And to all this our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> anſwered for Comfort and Patience, and ſaid theſe Words: <hi>Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou ſhalt be taken from all thy Pain, from all thy Sickneſs, from all thy Diſeaſe, and from all thy Woe. And thou ſhalt come up above, and thou ſhalt have me to thy meed, and thou ſhalt be fulfilled of joy and bliſs; and thou ſhalt never more have no manner of Pain, no manner of Sickneſs, no manner miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking, no wanting of will, but ever joy and bliſs without end. What ſhould it then grieve thee to ſuffer a while, ſithen it is my Will and my Worſhip?</hi> And in this word <hi>(ſuddenly thou ſhalt be taken.)</hi> I ſaw that <hi>God</hi> rewarded man of the patience that he hath in abiding of <hi>Gods</hi> will, and of his time. And that man <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi>
                     </note> lengeth his patience <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>far above.</hi>

This is a great profit; for if a man knew his time, he ſhould not have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over that time. And alſo <hi>God</hi> will that while the Soul is in the body, it ſeem to it ſelf that it is ever at the point to be taken (out thereof,) for all this Life and this longing that we have here is but a point. And when we be taken ſuddenly out of Pain into Bliſs, then Pain ſhall be nought. And in this time I ſaw a <hi>Body</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:204885:92"/> lying on the earth: Which body ſhewed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and fearful. and without ſhape and form, as it were a <note n="†" place="margin">i e. <hi>foul.</hi>
                     </note> ſwilge ſtinking myre. And ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly out of this body ſprung a full fair Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a little Child full ſhapen and formed, ſwift and lively, and whiter than the Lilly, which ſharply glided up into Heaven.

                     </note> ſwilge of the body betokeneth great wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of our deadly fleſh: And the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Child betokeneth the cleanneſs and the pureneſs of our Soul.

                     </note> bliveth no fairneſs of this Child, ne of this Child dwelleth no foulneſs of this body. It is full bliſs-ful (for) man to be taken from pain, more than pain to be taken from man; for if pain be taken from us, it may come again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a ſovereign Comfort, and a bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful beholding in a longing Soul, that we ſhall be taken from pain; for in this <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>

                     </note> behighting of clear Deliverance: For he will that we be comforted in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing joy.

And alſo he will that we take our abidings and our diſeaſes as lightly as we may take them, and ſet them at naught: For the lightlier that we take them, and the leſs price that we ſet at them for love, leſs pain ſhall we have in the feeling of them, and the more thank and meed ſhall we have for them.</p>

For as it was ſhewed, this reverence that I mean, is a holy, courteous dread of our <hi>Lord,</hi> to which meekneſs is knit; and that is, that a creature ſee <hi>the Lord</hi> marvellous great, and her ſelf marvellous litle: For theſe vertues are had endleſly to the Loved of <hi>God.</hi> And it may now be ſeen and felt in meaſure by the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our <hi>Lord,</hi> when it is: Which preſence in all thing is moſt deſired; for it worketh that marvellous ſickerneſs in true Faith, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker hope by greatneſs of Charity in dread that is ſweet and delectable. It is <hi>Gods</hi> will that I ſee my ſelf as much bound to him in Love, as if he had done for me all that he hath done. And thus ſhould every Soul think in regard of his Love; that is to ſay, the Charity of <hi>God</hi> maketh in us ſuch a unity, that when it is truly ſeen, no
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204885:94"/> man can part them ſelf from other. And thus ought each Soul to think that <hi>God</hi> hath done for him all that he hath done. And this ſheweth he to make us to love him, and liken him, and nothing dread but him; for it is his will we know that all the might of our enemies is lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Friends hands. And therefore the Soul that knoweth this ſickerly, he ſhall not dread but him that ſhe loveth. All other dreads ſhe ſet them among paſſions, and bodily ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and imaginations. And therefore though we been in ſo much pain, woe and diſeaſe that us thinketh, we can think right naught but that we are in, or that we feel; aſſoon as we may we paſs it lightly over, and ſet we it at naught. And why? for <hi>God</hi> will be known; for if we know him, and Love him, and reverently dread him, we ſhall have patience, and be in great reſt. And it ſhould been great liking to us all that he doth. And this ſhewed our <hi>Lord</hi> in theſe words: <hi>What ſhould it then agrieve thee to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a while, ſeeing it is my Will and my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</hi> Now have I told you of xv. Shewings, as <hi>God</hi> witſafe to miniſter them to my mind, renewed by Lightnings and Touchings, I hope, of the ſame Spirit that ſheweth them all. Of which xv. <hi>Shewings</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> began early in the morning, about the hour of four; and it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhewing by proceſs full fair and ſoberly, each following other till it was noon of the day, or paſt.</p>

                  <p>ANd after this the good <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed the <hi>xvjth. Revelation</hi> on the night following, as I ſhall ſay after. Which <hi>xvjth.</hi> was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and confirmation to all the xv. But firſt me behooveth to tell you as anenſt my feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wretchedneſs and blindneſs. I have ſaid at the beginning where it ſaith <hi>(And in this ſuddenly all my pain was taken from me.)</hi> Of which pain I had no grief, ne no diſeaſe, as long as the xv. <hi>Shewings</hi> laſted in ſhewing. And at the end all was cloſe, and I ſaw no more; and ſoon I felt that I ſhould live longer. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non my ſickneſs came again; firſt in my head with a ſound and a noiſe: And ſuddenly all my body was fulfilled with ſickneſs, like as it was before. And I was as barren and as dry as I had never had comfort but litle, and as a wretch mourned heavily for feeling of my bodily pains, and for faulting of comfort Ghoſtly and Bodily. Then came a Religious perſon unto me and asked me how I fared; and I ſaid, <hi>I had raved to day,</hi> and he laught lowd and inwardly: And I ſaid, <hi>The Croſs that ſtood before my face, methought it bled faſt.</hi> And with this word the Perſon that I ſpake to waxed all ſad and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:204885:95"/> And anon I was ſore aſhamed, and aſtoniſhed for my retchleſneſs. And I thought this man taketh ſadly the leaſt word that I may ſay, that ſaw no more thereof. And when I ſaw that he took it ſo ſadly, and with ſo great reverence, I waxed full greatly aſhamed, and would have been <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</hi>
                     </note> ſhriven, but I could tell it to no <hi>Prieſt;</hi> for I thought, <hi>How ſhould a Prieſt believe me, when I by ſaying I raved, I ſhewed my ſelf not to believe our Lord God.</hi> Notwithſtanding, I believed him truly for the time that I ſaw him. And ſo was then my will and my meaning ever for to doe without end: But as a Fool I let it paſs out of my mind. Ah, Loe how wretched I was; this was a great ſin and a great unkindneſs, that I for folly of feeling of a litle bodily pain, ſo unwiſely left for the time the comfort of all this bleſſed ſhewing of our <hi>Lord God.</hi> Here may you ſee what I am of my ſelf.

The colour was red like the Tile ſtone when it is new brent, with black ſpots therein, like frackles, fouler than the Tile-ſtone; his hair was red, as ruſt not ſcoured; afore with ſide Locks hanging down in flakes; he grinned upon me with a ſhrowd look, and ſhewed me white teeth: And ſo <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>much</hi>
                     </note> my kill me thought it the more ugly; body, ne hands had he none, ſhapely; but with his paws he held me in the throat, and would have ſtopped my breath, and kild me, but he might not.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204885:96"/> I asked them that were with me, if they felt any ſtench, they ſaid nay, they felt none; I ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> for then wiſt I well it was the fiend that was come only to tempt me.

                  <p>ANd then our good <hi>Lord</hi> opened my Ghoſtly eye, and ſhewed me my Soul in the midſt of my heart: I ſaw the Soul ſo large as it were and endleſs World, and alſo as it were a bleſſed Kingdom. And by the conditions that I ſaw therein, I underſtood that it is a worſhipful City. In mids of that City our <hi>Lord Jeſu very God and very Man,</hi> a fair Perſon and of large ſtature, Higheſt Biſhop, moſt Solemne King, Worſhipful <hi>Lord.</hi> And I ſaw him clothed ſolemnly in Worſhip; he ſitteth in the Soul, even right in Peace and reſt. And he ruleth and giveth Heaven and Earth, and all that is. The <hi>Man-hood</hi> with the <hi>God-head</hi> ſitteth in reſt: The <hi>God-head</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:204885:96"/> ruleth and giveth without any inſtrument or buſineſs. And the Soul is all occupied with the bleſſed <hi>God-head;</hi> that is, ſovereign Might, ſovereign Wiſdom, and ſevereign Goodneſs. The place that <hi>Jeſu</hi> taketh in our Soul he ſhall never remove without end, as to my ſight: for in us is his homlieſt home, and his endleſs dwelling. And in this he ſheweth the Liking that he hath of the making of mans Soul; for as well as the <hi>Father</hi> might make a Creature, and as well as the <hi>Son</hi> might make a Creature. So well would the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> that mans Soul were made, and ſo it was done. And therefore the bleſſedful <hi>Trinity</hi> enjoyeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end in the making of mans Soul: For he ſaw without beginning, what ſhould like him without end. All thing that he hath made ſheweth his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> as underſtanding was given in the ſame time by example of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is led to ſee great Nobleneſs, and Kingdoms longing to a <hi>Lord.</hi> And when it had ſeen all the Nobleneſs beneath, then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, it was ſtirred to ſeek up above to that high place where the <hi>Lord</hi> dwelleth; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reaſon that his dwelling is in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt place. And thus I underſtand truly that our Soul may never have reſt in things that is beneath it ſelf. And when it cometh above all Creatures into it ſelf, yet may it not abide in the beholding of it ſelf; but all the beholding is bleſſedfully ſet in <hi>God;</hi> that is,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:204885:97"/> the <hi>Maker</hi> dwelling therein; for in mans Soul is his very dwelling. And the higheſt Light and the brighteſt Shining of the City is the glorious Love of our <hi>Lord God,</hi> as to my ſight. And what may make us more enjoy in <hi>God,</hi> than to ſee in him that he enjoyeth in us higheſt of all his Works? For I ſaw in the ſame <hi>ſhewing</hi> that if the bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> might have made mans Soul any better, any fairer, any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler than it was made, he ſhould not have been full pleaſed with making of mans Soul: But for he made mans Soul as fair, as good, as precious, as he might make it a Creature, therefore the bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> is full pleaſed without end in the making of mans Soul. And he will that our hearts be mightily raiſed above the deepneſs of the earth, and all vain ſorrowes, and enjoy in him. This was a delectable ſight, and a reſtful ſhewing that is without end: And the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this whiles we are here, it is full pleaſant to <hi>God,</hi> and full great ſpeed to us. And the Soul that thus beholdeth, it maketh him like to him that is beholden, and oned it in reſt and in peace by his grace. And this was a ſingular joy and bliſs to me that I ſaw him ſitting: for the truth of ſitting ſhewed endleſs dwelling. And he gave me knowing truly that it was he that ſhewed me all before: and when I had behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all this with adviſement; then ſhewed our good <hi>Lords</hi> words full meekly, without voice, and without opening of lips, right as he had
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204885:97"/> done afore, and ſaid full ſweetly; <hi>Wit it now well, it was no raving that thou ſaweſt to day: but take it and believe it, and keep thee therein, and comfort thee therewith, and truſt thereto, and thou ſhalt not be overcome.</hi> Theſe laſt words were ſaid for learning of full true <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</hi>
                     </note> ſikerneſs; that is, our <hi>Lord Jeſu</hi> that ſhewed me all. And right as in the firſt word, that our good <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed, meaning his bleſſed Paſſion, herewith is the <hi>fiend overcome;</hi> right ſo he ſaid in the laſt word, with full true faithfulneſs meaning us all: <hi>Thou ſhalt not be overcome.</hi> And all this Learning and this true Comfort is general to <hi>all</hi> mine even Chriſten, as it is aforeſaid; and ſo is <hi>Gods</hi> will. And this word, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be overcome,</hi> was ſaid full ſharply, and full mightily for ſickneſs and comfort againſt all Tribulations that may come: He ſaid not, thou ſhalt not be troubled, thou ſhalt not be travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, thou ſhalt not be diſeaſed; but he ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be overcome. God</hi> will that we take heed at this word, and that we be ever mighty in faithful truſting in weal and woe; for he loveth us, and liketh us: and ſo will he that we Love him and Like him, and mightily truſt in him, and all ſhall be well: and ſoon all was cloſe, and I ſaw no more after this.</p>

I ſaw that <hi>two</hi> contraries ſhould not be together in one ſteed. The moſt contrarious that are is the higheſt bliſs, and the deepeſt pain.

Thus I ſaw how ſin is deadly for a ſhort time to the bleſſed Creatures of endleſs Life; and ever the more clearly that the Soul ſeeth the bliſsful chear by grace of Loving, the more it longeth to ſee it in fulhead; that is to ſay, in his own Likeneſs: For notwithſtanding that our <hi>Lord God</hi> dwelleth now in us, and is here with us, and <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth.</hi>
                     </note> colleth us, and becloſeth us for tender Love that he may never leave us, and is more near to us than Tongue may tell, or Heart may think: Yet may we never ſtint of mourning, ne of weeping, nor of ſeeking, nor of Longing, till when we ſee him clear in his bleſſedful chear: For in that precious ſight there may no Woe abide, nor Weal fail. And in this I ſaw matter of <hi>Mirth,</hi> and matter of <hi>Mourning:</hi> Matter of <hi>Mirth</hi> that our <hi>Lordour Maker</hi> is ſo near to us, and in us, and we in him by faithfulneſs of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his great goodneſs. Matter of <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for our Ghoſtly eye is ſo blind, and we ſo boarn down with Weight of our deadly fleſh, and Darkneſs of ſin, that we may not ſee our <hi>Lord God</hi> clearly in his bleſſedful chear; No, and becauſe of this Darkneſs, ſcarce we can believe or <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>think:</hi>
                     </note> trowe his great Love and our Faithfulneſs of keeping. And
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204885:101"/> therefore it is that I ſay, we may never leave off Mourning, ne Weeping: This Weeping meaneth not all in pouring out of tears by our bodily eye, but alſo to more Ghoſtly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for the <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>natural.</hi>
                     </note> kindly deſire of our Soul is ſo great, and ſo unmeaſurable, that if it were given us to our joy and our comfort, all the <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs.</hi>
                     </note> nobly that ever <hi>God</hi> made in Heaven and in Earth, and we ſaw not the fair bleſſedful chear of himſelf, yet ſhould we never leave mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ne of Ghoſtly Weeping; that is to ſay, of painful Longing, till when we ſee verily the fair bleſſedful chear of <hi>our Maker.</hi> And if we were in all the pain that heart may think, or tongue may tell; and we might in that time ſee his bleſſedful chear, all this pain ſhould us not grieve. Thus is that bleſſedful ſight end of all manner of pain to Loving Souls, and fulfilling of all manner of joy and bliſs. And that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he in the high marvellous Words where he ſaith; <hi>I it am that is higheſt; I it am that thou loveſt; I it am that is all.</hi> It longeth to us to have <hi>three</hi> manner of knowings. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that we know our <hi>Lord God:</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that we know our ſelf; what we are by him in kind and in grace: The <hi>third</hi> is, that we know meekly that our ſelf is againſt our ſin and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our feebleneſs. And for theſe three was all this ſhewing made, as to my underſtanding.</p>

                  <p>ALL this bleſſed teaching of our <hi>Lord God</hi> was ſhewed by <hi>three</hi> parts; that is to ſay, <hi>By bodily ſight, and by Word formed in my underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>by Ghoſtly ſight.</hi> For the <hi>bodily ſight,</hi> I have ſaid as I ſaw as truly as I can: And for the <hi>Words,</hi> I have ſaid them right as our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed them me: And for <hi>the Ghoſtly ſight,</hi> I have ſaid ſome deal, but I may never full tell it. And therefore of this <hi>Ghoſtly ſight</hi> I am ſtirred to ſay more as <hi>God</hi> will give me grace. <hi>God</hi> ſhewed <hi>two</hi> manner of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> that we have: That <hi>one</hi> is unpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or ſlouth; for we bear our travel and our pain heavily. That <hi>other</hi> is deſpair or doubtful dreed, as I ſhall ſay after: Generally he ſhewed <hi>ſin</hi> wherein all is comprehended, but in ſpecial he ſhewed none but theſe <hi>two.</hi> And theſe two are it that moſt travelleth and troubleth us, as by that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed me. Of which he will we be amended; I ſpeak of ſuch men and women that for <hi>Gods</hi> Love hate ſin, and diſpoſe them to do <hi>Gods</hi> Will: Then by our Ghoſtly blind-head and bodily heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we are moſt enclining to this. And therefore it is <hi>Gods</hi> will that they be known, and then ſhould we refuſe them, as we do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:204885:102"/> ſins. And for help againſt this, full meekly our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed the patience that he had in this hard Paſſion: And alſo the joy and the liking that he hath of that Paſſion for Love. And this he ſhewed in Example, that we ſhould gladly and eaſily bear our pains; for that is great pleaſing to him, and endleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to us. And the cauſe why we are travelled with them is for unknowing of Love. Though the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> be all even in the ſelf: The Soul took moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in <hi>Love;</hi> yea, and he will in all thing that we have our beholding and our enjoying in Love. And of this knowing are we moſt blind. For ſome of us believe that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>All mighty,</hi> and may do <hi>all;</hi> and that he is <hi>All wiſdom,</hi> and can do <hi>all:</hi> But that he is <hi>All Love</hi> and will do <hi>all,</hi> there we fail. And this unknowing it is that moſt letteth <hi>Gods</hi> Lovers, as to my ſight: For when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to hate ſin, and amend us by the ordinance of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> yet there dwelleth a dread that letteth us, by the beholding of our ſelf and of our ſin afore done. And ſome of us for our every day ſins, for we hold not our promiſe, nor keep our cleanneſs that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſetteth us in, but fall oft-times into ſo much wretchedneſs, that ſhame it is to ſay it. And the beholding of this maketh us ſo ſorry, and ſo heavy, that unneths we can ſee any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And this dread we take ſometime for a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:204885:103"/> meekneſs, but it is a foul blindneſs, and a wickedneſs. And we cannot deſpiſe it as we do another ſin that we know, which cometh through lack of true Judgment, and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain truth: For of all the properties of the bliſſedful <hi>Trinity</hi> it is <hi>Gods</hi> will that we have moſt Faithfulneſs and Liking in Love; for Love maketh Might and Wiſdom full meek to us. For right as by the courteſie of <hi>God</hi> he forgetteth our ſin after the time that we repent us: So will he that we forget our ſin as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our unskillful heavineſs, and our doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dreads.</p>

                  <p>FOr I underſtood <hi>four</hi> manner of <hi>Dreads: One</hi> is dread of a <note n="|" place="margin">i e. <hi>fright.</hi>
                     </note> fray that cometh to man ſuddenly by frailty. This dread doth good, for it helpeth to purge man, as doth bodily ſickneſs, or ſuch other pain that is not ſin; for all ſuch pains help man, if they be patiently taken. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is dread of pain; whereby man is ſtirred and waked fro ſleep of ſin: For man that is hard of ſleep of ſin, he is not able for the time to receive the ſoft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> till he hath undertaken
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:204885:103"/> this dread of pain, of bodily death and of Ghoſtly Enemies. And this dread ſtirreth us to ſeek Comfort and Mercy of <hi>God.</hi> And thus this dread helpeth us as an entry, and ableth us to have contrition by the bliſſedful touching of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> is doubtful dread: <hi>Doubtful dread</hi> is as much as it draweth to deſpair; <hi>God</hi> will have it turned in us into Love, by true knowing of Love; that is to ſay, that the bitterneſs of doubts be turned into ſweetneſs of kind Love by grace; for it may never pleaſe our <hi>Lord</hi> that his Servants doubt in his goodneſs. The <hi>fourth</hi> is <hi>Reverent Dread;</hi> for there is no dread that fully pleaſeth <hi>God</hi> in us, but reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dread, and that is ſoft. For the more it is had, the leſs it is felt for ſweetneſs of Love. Love and Dread are Brethren, and they are rooted in us by the goodneſs of our <hi>Maker,</hi> and they ſhall never be taken from us without end. We have of kind to Love, and we have of grace to Love; and have we of kind to dread, and we have of grace to dread. It longeth to the <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and to the <hi>Father-head</hi> to be dread, as it longeth to the goodneſs to be Loved: and it longeth to us that are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and his Children to dread him for <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and <hi>Father-head;</hi> as it longeth to us to Love him for <hi>God-head.</hi> And though this reverent Dread and Love be not both in one, but are two in property and in working, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:204885:104"/> neither of them may be had without other. And therefore I am ſure, he that Loveth he dreadeth, though he feel it but little. All dreads other than reverend dread that are proferred to us, though they come under colour of Holineſs, they are not ſo true. And hereby may they be known aſunder. That dread that maketh us haſtily to flee fro all that is not good, and fall into our <hi>Lords</hi> breaſt; as the Child into the Mothers arme, with all our intent, and with all our mind, knowing our feebleneſs and our great need, knowing his everlaſting Goodneſs and his bleſſed Love, only ſeeking into him for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cleaving to with faithful truſt: That dread that bringeth us into this Working, it is kind and gracious, and good, and true. And all that is contrarious to this, either it is wrong, or it is medled with wrong. Then is this the remedy to know them both, and refuſe the wrong: For the kind property of dread which we have in this Life by the gracious Working of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the ſame ſhall be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven afore <hi>God,</hi> gentle, courteous, full ſweet. And thus we ſhall in Love be homely and near to <hi>God.</hi> And we in dread be gentle and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to <hi>God,</hi> and both in one manner like <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>equal</hi>
                     </note> even. Deſire we then of our <hi>Lord God</hi> to dread him reverently, and Love him meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to truſt in him mightily: For when we dread him reverently, and love him meekly,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:204885:104"/> our truſt is never in vain; for the more that we truſt, and the mightilier that we truſt, the more we pleaſe and worſhip our <hi>Lord</hi> that we truſt in. And if us fail this reverent dread and meek Love, as <hi>God</hi> forbid we ſhould, our truſt ſhall ſoon be miſ-ruled for that time. And therefore us needeth much to pray our <hi>Lord</hi> of grace that we may have this reverent dread, and make Love of his Gift in Heart and in Work, for without this no man may pleaſe <hi>God.</hi>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204885:105"/> more and more, as it is convenient and ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us.

The <hi>third</hi> is, to fulfill us of bliſs, and that ſhall be on the laſt day fulfilled ever to laſt. For I ſaw, as it is known in our Faith, that then pain and ſorrow ſhall be ended to all that ſhall be ſaved. And not only we ſhall receive the ſame bliſs that Souls afore have had in Heaven, but alſo we ſhall receive a new, which plentuouſly ſhall flie out of <hi>God</hi> into us, and fulfill us. And thoſe be the goods which he hath ordained to give us from without beginning. Theſe goods are treaſured and hid in himſelf; for into that time Creature is not mighty, ne worthy to receive them. In this we ſhould ſee verily the cauſe of all the Deeds that <hi>God</hi> hath done. And over-more we ſhould ſee the cauſe of all thing that he hath ſuffered: And the bliſs, and the fulfilling ſhall be ſo deep and ſo high, that for Wonder and Marvel all Creatures ſhould have to <hi>God</hi> ſo great reverent and dread over-paſſing, that hath been ſeen and felt before that the Pillars of Heaven ſhall travel and quake.

For the Soul that beholdeth the kindneſs of our <hi>Lord Jeſu,</hi> it hateth no Hell; but Hell is ſin as to my ſight. And therefore it is <hi>Gods</hi> will that we know ſin, and pray buſily, and travel wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſeek teaching meekly, that we fall not blindly therein; and if we fall, that we riſe readily: for it is the moſt pain that the Soul may have to turn from <hi>God</hi> any time by ſin.

And we may not for the time ſee the Fair-head of <hi>God,</hi> but if we may behold them with Contrition with him, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on him, and with Holy deſire to <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:204885:106"/> for him.

This bleſſed Friend is <hi>Jeſu,</hi> and it is his Will and Counſel that we hold us with him, and faſten us homely to him, evermore in what ſtate ſoever we bene: For whether we be foul or clean, we are ever one in his Loving. For weal, ne for woe he will never we flee him; but for the change-ability that we are in our ſelf, we fall often into ſin; than have we this by the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Enemy, and by our own Folly and Blindneſs: For they ſay thus, <hi>Thou woteſt well thou art a Wretch, a Sinner, and alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, for thou keepeſt not thy Covenant. Thou promiſeſt oftentimes our Lord that thou ſhalt do better; and anon thou falleſt again in the ſame, namely in ſlouth, and leeſing of time.</hi> For that is the beginning of ſin as to my ſight; and namely, to the Creatures that have given themſelf to ſerve our <hi>Lord</hi> with inward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of his bleſſedful goodneſs.

And this glorious riſing it is ſo great ſorrow and pain to him, for the hate that he hath to our Soul, that he brenneth continually in envy.

                  <p>OUr <hi>Lord</hi> of his mercy ſheweth us our ſin and our feebleneſs by the ſweet gracious ſight of himſelf. For our ſin is ſo foul and ſo horrible, that he of his curteſie will not ſhew it us but by the Light of his Mercy. Of <hi>four</hi> things, it is his Will that we have knowing: The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that he is the ground of whom we have all our Life and our Being. The <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> is, that he keepeth us mightily and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully in the time that we are in our ſin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all our Enemies that are full fell upon us. And ſomuch we are in the more peril, for we give them occaſion thereto, and we know not our own need. The <hi>third</hi> is, how curteouſly he keepeth us, and maketh us to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:204885:109"/> know that we go amiſs. The <hi>fourth</hi> is, how ſtedfaſtly he abideth us, and changeth no chear; for he will that we be turned and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in Love, as he is to us. And thus by gracious knowing we may ſee our ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable without deſpair: For ſoothly us need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſee it; and by the ſight we ſhould be made aſhamed of our ſelf, &amp; breaking down as againſt our Pride and our Preſumption: For us behooveth verily to ſee that of our ſelf we are right naught but Sin and Wretchedneſs. And thus by the ſight of the Leſs <hi>(part of ſin)</hi> that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſheweth us, the more is waſted, which we ſee not: For he of his courteſie meaſureth the ſight to us: For it is ſo foul and ſo horrible, that we ſhould not endure to ſee it as it is. And thus by this meek knowing through Contrition and Grace we ſhall be broken from all thing that is not our <hi>Lord.</hi> And then ſhall our bleſſed Saviour perfectly cure us, and one us to him. This breaking, and this curing our <hi>Lord</hi> meaneth by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral man; for he that is higheſt and neareſt with <hi>God,</hi> he may ſee himſelf ſinful and needy with me. And I that am the leaſt and the loweſt of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved; I may be comforted with him that is higheſt: So hath our <hi>Lord</hi> oned us in Charity, when he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that I ſhould ſin. And for joy that I had in beholding him, I entended not readily
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204885:109"/> to that ſhewing. And our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> reſted there, and would no further teach me, till when that he gave me Grace and Will to entend. And hereof was I Learned, though that we be highly lifted into Contemplation by the ſpecial gift of our <hi>Lord,</hi> yet us behoov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth needs therewith to have ſight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſin, and of our feebleneſs. For without this knowing we may not have true meekneſs; and without this we may not be ſafe. And alſo I ſaw we may not have this knowing of our ſelf, nor of none of all our Ghoſtly Enemies; for they will not us ſo much good: For if it were by their Will, we ſhould never ſee it till our ending day. Then are we much bound to <hi>God</hi> that he will himſelf for Love ſhew it us in time of mercy and grace.</p>

                  <p>ALſo I had in this more underſtanding, in that he ſhewed me that I ſhould ſin. I took it nakedly to my own ſingular Perſon for I was no otherwiſe ſtirred in that time: But by the high gracious comfort that followed after I ſaw, that his meaning was for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man; that is to ſay, all man which is ſinful,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204885:110"/> and ſhall be into the Laſt day: Of which man I am a Member as I hope by the mercy of <hi>God;</hi> for the bleſſed comfort that I ſaw, it is large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us all. And there was I Learned that I ſhould ſee mine own ſin, and not other mens, but if it may be for comfort or help of my <hi>even Chriſten.</hi> And alſo in the ſame ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there I ſaw that I ſhould ſin: There was I Learned to be dreadful for <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>frailty.</hi>
                     </note> unſikerneſs of my ſelf. For I wot not how I ſhall fall, ne I know not the meaſure, ne the greatneſs of my ſin: For that would <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired with fear to have known.</hi>
                     </note> I a wiſt dreadful; and thereto I had none anſwer. Alſo our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> in that ſame time, he ſhewed full ſweetly and full mightily the endleſs-head, and the unchange-ability of his Love: and alſo his great goodneſs, and his gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly keeping, that the Love of him and of our Souls ſhall never be departed into without end. And thus in the dread I have matter of meekneſs, that ſaveth me fro Preſumption. And in the bleſſed ſhewing of Love I have matter of true Comfort and of Joy, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me from diſpair. All this homely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our courteous <hi>Lord</hi> it is a Lovely Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a ſweet gracious Teaching of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in comforting of our Soul: For he will that we know by the ſweetneſs of the homely Love of him, that all that we ſee or feel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or without, which is contrarious to this, that it is of the Enemy, and not of <hi>God;</hi> as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204885:110"/> thus, If that we be ſtirred to be the more retchleſſer of our Living, or of the keeping of our heart, becauſe that we have knowing of this plentuous Love; than needeth us greatly to beware of this ſtirring, if it come. It is untrue, and greatly we owe to hate it, for it hath no likeneſs of <hi>Gods</hi> Will; and when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen by frailty or blindneſs. Then our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Lord</hi> touching us, ſtirreth us and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And then will he that we ſee our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and meekly be it a known. But he will not that we abide therewith, ne he will not that we buſie us greatly about our accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ne he will not that we be too wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on our ſelf; but he will that we haſtily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to him: For he ſtandeth all alone, and abideth us continually, moaning and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till when we come. And he hath haſte to have us to him: For we are his joy and his delight, and he is our Salve of our Life; there I ſay he ſtandeth all alone.

Of which greatneſs he will we have knowing here as it were in an A. B. C. that is to ſay, that we may have a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof we ſhould have fulhead in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and that is for to ſpeed us. We know in our Faith that <hi>God</hi> alone took our kind, and none but hee: And furthermore, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone did all the great Works that longeth to our Salvation, and none but he: And right ſo he alone doth now in the laſt end; that is to ſay, he dwelleth here in us, and ruleth us, and giveth us in this Living, and bringeth us to his bliſs. And thus ſhall he do as long as any Soul is in Earth that ſhall come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And ſo far forth, that if there were none
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204885:111"/> ſuch Soul in Earth but one, he ſhould be with that all alone, till he had brought it up to his bliſs. I believe and underſtand the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Holy Angels</hi> as <hi>Clarkes</hi> tell; but it was not ſhewed me: For himſelf is neareſt and meekeſt, higheſt and loweſt, and doth all. And not only all that us needeth, but alſo he doth all that is Worſhipful to our joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And there I ſay he abideth us moaning and mourning. It meaneth all the true feeling that we have in our ſelf in Contrition and in Compaſſion; and all moaning and mourning, for we are not oned with our <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſuch as is ſpeedful it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in us. And though ſome of us feel it ſeldom, it paſſeth never fro <hi>Chriſt,</hi> till what time he have brought us out of all our Woe: For Love ſuffereth him never to be without pity. And what time that we fall into ſin, and leave the mind of him, and the keeping of our own Soul, then beareth <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone all the charge of us. And thus ſtandeth he moaning and mourning. Then Longeth it to us for reverence and kindneſs to turn us haſtily to our <hi>Lord,</hi> and let him not all alone; he is here alone with us all; that is to ſay, only for us he is here. And what time I be ſtrange to him by ſin, deſpair, or ſlouth, then I let my <hi>Lord</hi> ſtand alone, in as much as he is in me. And thus it fareth with us all which be ſinners. But though it be ſo that we do thus oftentimes, his goodneſs ſuffereth us never to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:204885:112"/> be alone, but laſtingly he is with us, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly he excuſeth us, and ever keepeth us from blame in his ſight.</p>

And in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner he ſhewed him in Earth, thus as it were a Pilgrimage; that is to ſay, he is here with us leading us, and ſhall be till when he hath brought us all to his bliſs in Heaven. He ſhewed him diverſe times raigning, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; but principally in mans Soul: He hath taken there his reſting place, and his Worſhipful City; out of which Worſhipful <note n="*" place="margin">i e. <hi>ſcat</hi>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:204885:112"/> that he ſeeth all our Living here to be Penance. For kind Longing in us to him is a Laſting Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in us, which Penance he worketh in us, and mercifully helpeth us to bear it; for his Love maketh him to Long: his Wiſdom and his Truth with his rightful-head maketh him to ſuffer us here. And in this manner he will ſee it in us; for this is our kindly Penance, and the higheſt to my ſight. For this Penance cometh never fro us, till what time that we be fulfilled, when we ſhould have him to our meed. And therefore he will that we ſet our hearts in the over-paſſing; that is to ſay, fro the pain that we feel into the bliſs that we truſt.</p>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:204885:113"/> beheld the Servant with Pity, and not with blaim; for this paſſing Life asketh not to Live all without ſin.

And thus by the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we get in the ſight of our ſin, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing his everlaſting Love, him thanking and praiſing, we pleaſe him. <hi>I love thee and thou loveſt me, and our love ſhall never be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on two; and for thy profit I ſuffer.</hi> And all this was ſhewed in Ghoſtly underſtanding, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this bleſſed word; <hi>I keep thee full</hi>

Thereby I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that all that is contrarious to this, it is not of him, but it is of Enmity. And he will that we know it by the ſweet gracious Light of his kind Love. If any ſuch Liver be in Earth which is continually kept from falling, I know it not; for it was not ſhewed me. But this was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in falling, and in riſing we are ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly kept in one Love, <hi>(by which we were ehoſen before others from all eternity.)</hi> For in the beholding of <hi>God</hi> we fall not.
